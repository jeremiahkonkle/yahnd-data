Coroutines and their discontents are well known. But the author has some good points about cancellation.<p>Cancellation isn&#x27;t well-studied. It has two main cases - canceling a wait, and interrupting actual computation. The first case comes up more often.<p>If anything that can wait can be aborted, then things unwind better. Language support for this needs to be block-structured, as in Python&#x27;s<p><pre><code>    Lock lok;\n    with lok :\n      (do something)\n</code></pre>\nPython uses exceptions, so the appropriate mechanism there would be to indicate lock failure with an exception, and not execute the &quot;with&quot; block. In error code languages, the locking block should return an error code.<p>Once a thread&#x2F;coroutine&#x2F;whatever is in cancellation, all waits should abort. So you rapidly fall through the code until the concurrent construct reaches its exit point. Unwinding still takes place. Non-blocking concurrency primitives should be allowed in this mode, so you can add things to a list, but can&#x27;t wait on I&#x2F;O. RAII things like file-closing on block exit have to be done that way, because the canceled construct can&#x27;t wait for them.<p>QNX real-time messaging works something like this. QNX&#x27;s basic interprocess communication primitive is MsgSend, which sends a message and waits for a reply. MsgSend can be canceled, or can time out; an error code is returned.  All I&#x2F;O requests are MsgSend operations and thus can be canceled. In QNX, everything that can block can be timed out or canceled. This is used to place upper bounds on how long things can take.<p>Canceling a compute loop is harder. If the compute loop is operating only on local data, it&#x27;s not so bad. You need some data flow analysis to determine that the function being forced to error out doesn&#x27;t have non-local side effects.  If, say, you&#x27;re inverting a matrix, and that needs to be aborted, you need to be sure that the matrix is never looked at again. This is probably easier in functional languages.<p>Once wait cancellation under control, so the thing you&#x27;re canceling can&#x27;t block, having to wait for the other thread&#x2F;coroutine&#x2F;whatever to reach its join point isn&#x27;t so bad. You don&#x27;t need to kill it; you can wait for it to unwind.

I'm not sure that\nit's useful, but here is my personal opinion on the proposed\n\"assignment expressions\".\n\nPEP 572 -- Assignment Expressions:\nhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/\n\nFirst of all, I concur with others: Chris Angelico did a great job to\ndesign a good and full PEP, and a working implementation which is also\nuseful to play with it!\n\nWARNING! I was (strongly) opposed to PEP 448 Unpacking Generalizations\n(ex: [1, 2, *list]) and PEP 498 f-string (f\"Hello {name}\"), whereas I\nam now a happy user of these new syntaxes. So I'm not sure that I have\ngood tastes :-)\n\n\nTim Peter gaves the following example. \"LONG\" version:\n\ndiff = x - x_base\nif diff:\n    g = gcd(diff, n)\n    if g > 1:\n        return g\n\nversus the \"SHORT\" version:\n\nif (diff := x - x_base) and (g := gcd(diff, n)) > 1:\n    return g\n\n== Write ==\n\nIf your job is to write code: the SHORT version can be preferred since\nit's closer to what you have in mind and the code is shorter. When you\nread your own code, it seems straightforward and you like to see\neverything on the same line.\n\nThe LONG version looks like your expressiveness is limited by the\ncomputer. It's like having to use simple words when you talk to a\nchild, because a child is unable to understand more subtle and\nadvanced sentences. You want to write beautiful code for adults,\nright?\n\n== Read and Understand ==\n\nIn my professional experience, I spent most of my time on reading\ncode, rather than writing code. By reading, I mean: try to understand\nwhy this specific bug that cannot occur... is always reproduced by the\ncustomer, whereas we fail to reproduce it in our test lab :-) This bug\nis impossible, you know it, right?\n\nSo let's say that you never read the example before, and it has a bug.\n\nBy \"reading the code\", I really mean understanding here. In your\nopinion, which version is easier to *understand*, without actually\nrunning the code?\n\nIMHO the LONG version is simpler to understand, since the code is\nstraightforward, it's easy to \"guess\" the *control flow* (guess in\nwhich order instructions will be executed).\n\nPrint the code on paper and try to draw lines to follow the control\nflow. It may be easier to understand how SHORT is more complex to\nunderstand than LONG.\n\n== Debug ==\n\nNow let's imagine that you can run the code (someone succeeded to\nreproduce the bug in the test lab!). Since it has a bug, you now\nlikely want to try to understand why the bug occurs using a debugger.\n\nSadly, most debugger are designed as if a single line of code can only\nexecute a single instruction. I tried pdb: you cannot only run (diff\n:= x - x_base) and then get \"diff\" value, before running the second\nassingment, you can only execute the *full line* at once.\n\nI would say that the LONG version is easier to debug, at least using pdb.\n\nI'm using regularly gdb which implements the \"step\" command as I\nexpect (don't execute the full line, execute sub expressions one by\none), but it's still harder to follow the control flow when a single\nline contains multiple instructions, than debugging lines with a\nsingle instruction.\n\nYou can see it as a limitation of pdb, but many tools only have the\ngranularity of whole line. Think about tracebacks. If you get an\nexception at \"line 1\" in the SHORT example (the long \"if\" expression),\nwhat can you deduce from the line number? What happened?\n\nIf you get an exception in the LONG example, the line number gives you\na little bit more information... maybe just enough to understand the\nbug?\n\n\nExample showing the pdb limitation:\n\n>>> def f():\n...  breakpoint()\n...  if (x:=1) and (y:=2): pass\n...\n>>> f()\n> <stdin>(3)f()\n\n(Pdb) p x\n*** NameError: name 'x' is not defined\n(Pdb) p y\n*** NameError: name 'y' is not defined\n\n(Pdb) step\n--Return--\n> <stdin>(3)f()->None\n\n(Pdb) p x\n1\n(Pdb) p y\n2\n\n... oh, pdb gone too far. I expected a break after \"x := 1\" and before\n\"y := 2\" :-(\n\n\n== Write code for babies! ==\n\nPlease don't write code for yourself, but write code for babies! :-)\nThese babies are going to maintain your code for the next 5 years,\nwhile you moved to a different team or project in the meanwhile. Be\nkind with your coworkers and juniors!\n\nI'm trying to write a single instruction per line whenever possible,\neven if the used language allows me much more complex expressions.\nEven if the C language allows assignments in if, I avoid them, because\nI regularly have to debug my own code in gdb ;-)\n\nNow the question is which Python are allowed for babies. I recall that\na colleague was surprised and confused by context managers. Does it\nmean that try/finally should be preferred? What about f'Hello\n{name.title()}' which calls a method into a \"string\" (formatting)? Or\nmetaclasses? I guess that the limit should depend on your team, and\nmay be explained in the coding style designed by your whole team?\n\nVictor\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious message (by thread): [Python-Dev] PEP 573 -- Module State Access from C Extension Methods\n\nNext message (by thread): [Python-Dev] PEP 572: Write vs Read, Understand and Control Flow\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the Python-Dev\nmailing list\n", "\n\nPrevious message (by thread): [Python-Dev] PEP 573 -- Module State Access from C Extension Methods\n\nNext message (by thread): [Python-Dev] PEP 572: Write vs Read, Understand and Control Flow\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the Python-Dev\nmailing list\n"], "title": "PEP 572: Write vs. Read, Understand and Control Flow", "by": "edward", "score": 44, "time": 1524946768, "top_comment": {"kids": [16949836, 16956047, 16950752], "parent": 16949248, "text": "As a long-time Python user, this is one of the worst proposals I&#x27;ve seen.<p>Yes, it has a potential for being useful.<p>But its usefulness, unlike context managers and async, is very limited, implied a substantial cognitive overhead by introducing a new operator, and has a very significant potential for abuse.<p>One of the nice things about Python is that it is highly succing while disallowing the sort of expressions that are too information-dense to be easily understood, which has been a critique of mine in other languages of similar use cases (Clojure, Haskell, I&#x27;m looking at you).<p>Succinctness is good if it allows expressing ideas in a way that maximize comprehensibility and go straight to the point.<p>But truth is, nobody&#x27;s missing out on serious functionality by not being able to do an assignment on the same line of code as a conditional.

The explore page has become a mass of memes, &quot;viral&quot; videos, half naked women, spam, reposts from reddit, reposts of other reposts, and so on.

Can we delay age-related decline in cognitive function with interventions and stave off Alzheimer's disease? Does an aged brain really have the capacity to change in response to stimulation? In the present paper, we consider the neuroplasticity of the aging brain, that is, the brain's ability to increase capacity in response to sustained experience. We argue that, although there is some neural deterioration that occurs with age, the brain has the capacity to increase neural activity and develop neural scaffolding to regulate cognitive function. We suggest that increase in neural volume in response to cognitive training or experience is a clear indicator of change, but that changes in activation in response to cognitive training may be evidence of strategy change rather than indicative of neural plasticity. We note that the effect of cognitive training is surprisingly durable over time, but that the evidence that training effects transfer to other cognitive domains is relatively limited.

In contrast to the message relentlessly promoted by lifestyle gurus these days, this book would argue that four hours a night is probably fine, that caffeine before bed is no big deal, and that even severe sleep deprivation poses no real risk of poor performance, health troubles or early death. Admittedly, this might raise certain ethical issues, since that\u2019s not what the science says. But you know what? Unlike all those other books, this one would help people sleep. Because take it from an intermittent bad sleeper: there\u2019s nothing more likely to keep an insomniac up at night, or turn a good sleeper into an insomniac, than being told it\u2019s completely essential they drift off.", "Actually, the ironies of insomnia are even worse than that, because there\u2019s growing evidence that thinking of yourself as an insomniac \u2013 having an \u201cinsomnia identity\u201d, in the coinage of the sleep researcher Kenneth Lichstein \u2013 is a major part of the problem. It\u2019s not just that such a self-image makes it harder to sleep, though doubtless that\u2019s the case. It\u2019s that having an insomnia identity makes life terrible even if, in reality, you\u2019re getting sufficient sleep. In a review of the research published last year, Lichstein concluded that \u201cnon-complaining poor sleepers\u201d \u2013 who sleep badly but don\u2019t define themselves as insomniacs \u2013 don\u2019t suffer the high blood pressure commonly associated with severe sleeplessness. Meanwhile, \u201ccomplaining good sleepers\u201d \u2013 who get enough shut-eye, but are heavily invested in their alleged insomnia \u2013 were essentially as tired, anxious and depressed as those who genuinely didn\u2019t sleep.", "And the worst part, arguably, is this: with an insomnia identity, seeking help is liable to make things worse. Drag your weary bones to the doctor and she may be willing to prescribe sleeping pills. But apart from the fact that they\u2019re not very effective, and often very addictive, the benefits are likely to be outweighed by the very act of visiting the doctor: by doing so, you\u2019ve doubled down on your insomnia identity, signalling to your subconscious mind that you have an intransigent problem, requiring medical intervention. Reading all this, some chronic insomniacs may protest that I\u2019m making light of their own, far more serious condition, which really is intransigent. Perhaps. But do bear in mind that\u2019s exactly what someone with a strong insomnia identity would say.", "The root of the problem, as Sasha Stephens explains in her book The Effortless Sleep Method, is that any external crutch on which you lean \u2013 not just pills, but herbal remedies and elaborate bedtime rituals, too \u2013 risks further eroding your trust in your ability to fall asleep on your own, and it\u2019s that lack of self-trust that is insomnia\u2019s main cause. (Obviously, don\u2019t stop taking prescription drugs without consulting a doctor.)

", "During the Cold War, Japan\u2019s Air Force deployed some of the most advanced aerial warfare capabilities in the world. The country\u2019s large economy and strategic importance to the U.S.-led alliance network led it to be provided with the most elite American made fighters available. While lower tier U.S. allies such as South Vietnam and the Philippines were provided with lighter second generation F-5 fighters, Japan was sold large numbers of the heavy F-4 Phantom and was even permitted to jointly produce the fighters domestically. Japan went on to become an early operator of the fourth generation F-15, one of only three U.S. allies sold advanced air superiority variants of the fighter alongside Israel and Saudi Arabia.\u00a0Most U.S. allies had to make do with the lighter and less capable F-16.", "While Japan expected receive to and showed strong interest in acquiring the U.S. F-22 Raptor, an elite fifth generation air superiority fighter and the successor to the F-4 and F-15, in the mid 2000s Tokyo was prevented from acquiring the fighter due to a blanket congressional export ban. The decision not to sell Japan a modern replacement to the F-15 continues to seriously hinder Japan\u2019s security to this day, and the country has all but completely lost its Cold War era air superiority advantage in light of the fast growing capabilities of neighboring China \u2013 with Beijing\u2019s fleet today vastly surpassing that of Tokyo both quantitatively and qualitatively.", "While Japan was unable to acquire the F-22, the United States has heavily marketed the F-35 to Tokyo. Though the F-35 is also a fifth generation fighter, it was designed as a single engine light platform and its air-to-air combat capabilities leave much to be desired compared to those of the elite F-22 \u2014 and even those of advanced fourth generation fighters such as the F-15J and China\u2019s J-11B. The platform was designed as a lower cost complement to the Raptor to be widely exported, a successor to the F-5 and F-16 lacking the cutting edge air-to-air combat capabilities of heavier fighters Japan was able to acquire during the Cold War.", "While the F-35 retains some radar evading capabilities, its radar cross section is over ten times greater than that of the F-22 making it far less survivable \u2014 leading some analysts to term it a \u201cpseudo stealthy\u201d\u00a0fighter. The F-35 has less than half the range of the larger F-22 and lacks the Raptor\u2019s advanced long ranged air-to-air missiles, which for an archipelago nation separated from its potential adversaries by vast seas are major shortcomings. As a single engine light platform with a small arsenal of just four air-to-air missiles, restricted to a below average speed of Mach 1.6 and a very low altitude relative to the Raptor, the F-15J, and elite twin engine Chinese fighters,\u00a0the F-35 hardly presents an adequate solution to counter China\u2019s growing fleet of J-11 fighters \u2014 let alone more advanced platforms more recently deployed by Beijing such as the Su-35 or J-20. Indeed, it was never designed for such an air superiority role.", "U.S. military officials and numerous think tanks have repeatedly stressed that the F-35 is not an air superiority platform and cannot replace the F-15. Former Air Force chief of staff\u00a0General Mark Welsh stated\u00a0that the F-35 \u201cwas never designed to be the next dog fighting machine. It was designed to be the multipurpose, data-integration platform that could do all kinds of things in the air-to-ground arena including dismantle enemy, integrated, air defenses. It had an air-to-air capability, but it was not intended to be an air-superiority fighter. That was the F-22.\u201d\u00a0Air Combat Command chief General Mike Hostage similarly stated\u00a0regarding the F-35\u2019s lack of air superiority capabilities: \u201cIf I do not keep that F-22 fleet viable, the F-35 fleet frankly will be irrelevant. The F-35 is not built as an air superiority platform. It needs the F-22.\u201d Stressing the Raptor\u2019s importance, Hostage predicted that, while the F-35 was unsuitable for an air superiority role, the F-15 would be obsolete by 2024."], "title": "Why the F-35 Isn\u2019t Good Enough for Japan", "by": "Jerry2", "score": 35, "time": 1525059491, "top_comment": {"kids": [16955824], "parent": 16955543, "text": "Australia couldn&#x27;t be more eager to spend tens of billions on this white elephant.<p>But of course anything the U.S. says is good for Australia just has to be, right?<p>We&#x27;d have been better off spending billions buying anti ship missiles.", "by": "throwaway000021", "time": 1525063144, "type": "comment", "id": 16955772}, "type": "story", "id": 16955543}, "107": {"kids": [16956093, 16954022, 16955844, 16955970, 16956928, 16956330, 16955968, 16958577, 16958531, 16956302, 16956175, 16957818, 16960490, 16961076, 16961331, 16967241, 16957447, 16957091, 16960138, 16956907, 16956679, 16955838], "descendants": 116, "url": "http://sam.zeloof.xyz/first-ic/#", "text": ["\"It's not enough to have a dream, you have to have a garage.\"", "I am very excited to\u00a0announce the details of my first integrated circuit and share the journey that this project has taken me on over the past year.

It makes implementing your tutorials less work. Your game will be easier to comprehend because it is presenting its information and state in a way that is designed to be naturally accessible. This means that when you sit down to make a tutorial (which, wow what a nightmare these are), half the work has already been done for you. And a better tutorial means more people who get into your game across all skill-levels.\n\n\t  2. Improves organic discovery. When your game is good at teaching onlookers to play, it'll draw in more viewers, and every player and every streamer of your game can focus on conveying how awesome it is, instead of constantly answering questions about how the game works\n\n\t  3.

As desks go, this one saw some impressive action. By \r\nthe time he retired from the National Security Agency in 1955, Friedman \r\nhad served for more than thirty years as his government\u2019s chief \r\ncryptographer, and\u2014as leader of the team that broke the Japanese PURPLE \r\ncode in World War II, co-inventor of the US Army\u2019s best cipher machine, \r\nauthor of the papers that gave the field its mathematical foundations, \r\nand coiner of the very term cryptanalysis\u2014he had arguably become the most important code-breaker in modern history.1", "At first glance, the photo looks like a standard-issue keepsake of \r\nthe kind owned by anyone who has served in the military. Yet Friedman \r\nfound it so significant that he had a second, larger copy framed for the\r\n wall of his study. When he looked at the oblong image, taken in Aurora,\r\n Illinois, on a winter\u2019s day in 1918, what did Friedman see? He saw \r\nseventy-one officers, soon to be sent to the war in France, for whom he \r\nhad designed a crash course on the theory and practice of cryptology. He\r\n saw his younger self at one end of the mysterious group of black-clad \r\ncivilians seated in the center; and at the other end he saw the \r\nformidable figure of George Fabyan, the director of Riverbank \r\nLaboratories in nearby Geneva, where Friedman found not just his \r\ncryptographic calling but also his wife Elizebeth (flanked here by two \r\nother instructors from Riverbank\u2019s Department of Ciphers). And he saw a \r\ncoded message, hiding in plain sight. As a note on the back of the \r\nlarger print explains, the image is a cryptogram in which people stand \r\nin for letters; and thanks to Friedman\u2019s careful positioning, they spell\r\n out the words \u201cKNOWLEDGE IS POWER.\u201d (Or rather they almost do: for one \r\nthing, they were four people short of the number needed to complete the \r\n\u201cR.\u201d)", "The photograph was an enduring reminder, then, of Friedman\u2019s favorite \r\naxiom\u2014and he was so fond of the phrase that some fifty years later he \r\nhad it inscribed as the epitaph on his tomb in Arlington National \r\nCemetery.2\u00a0It captures a formative moment in a life spent looking for more than meets the eye, and it remained Friedman\u2019s most cherished example of how, using the art and science of codes, it was possible to make anything \r\nsignify anything. This idea will no doubt strike us as quintessentially \r\nmodern, if not postmodern, but Friedman took it straight from the great \r\nRenaissance scholar-statesman Sir Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626), along with \r\nboth the hidden motto in the image and the method used to convey it. In \r\nother words, the graduation photo from Friedman\u2019s earliest course in \r\nmilitary cryptanalysis is at once a tribute to Bacon\u2019s philosophy and a \r\nmaster class in the use of his biliteral cipher.", "Bacon devised this ingenious code in the late 1570s (when he spent three\r\n years in the entourage of the English ambassador in France), but he did\r\n not describe its workings until 1623.3\u00a0The cipher was based, as the name \u201cbiliteral\u201d suggests, on a system \r\nusing only two letters\u2014or, more precisely, one where each letter in the \r\nalphabet is represented by some combination of a\u2019s and b\u2019s.\r\n When Bacon realized that it was possible to represent all twenty-six \r\nletters in permutations of only two by using groups of five, he \r\ngenerated the following key:4", "A = aaaaa B = aaaab C = aaaba D = aaabb E = aabaa F = aabab G = aabba H = aabbb I/J = abaaa K = abaab L = ababa M = ababb N = abbaa O = abbab P = abbba Q = abbbb R = baaaa S = baaab T = baaba U/V = baabb W = babaa X = babab Y = babba Z = babbb ", "The crucial point in Bacon\u2019s system is that the a\u2019s and b\u2019s in the ciphered text are not represented by those actual letters. If they were (using what is known as a straightforward substitution\u00a0cipher5), a message reading \u201cHi\u201d would simply appear as \u201caabbb abaaa\u201d: anyone \r\nintercepting the text would quickly see that it was in code, and\u2014given \r\nenough text and time\u2014would easily discover the key. His way around this \r\nproblem was as powerful as it was simple: he allowed the a\u2019s and b\u2019s in his system to designate the different forms of anything that can be \r\ndivided into two classes, sorts, or types (which Bacon referred to as \r\nthe a-form and the b-form)."], "title": "How to Make Anything Signify Anything (2011)", "by": "benbreen", "score": 59, "time": 1524967664, "top_comment": {"parent": 16950406, "text": "This article discusses the history of Bacon&#x27;s cipher: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bacon%27s_cipher\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bacon%27s_cipher</a>", "id": 16960640, "time": 1525110188, "type": "comment", "by": "allenz"}, "type": "story", "id": 16950406}, "150": {"kids": [16959802, 16959510, 16959310, 16960487, 16959744, 16960547, 16959514, 16959507, 16959341, 16959649, 16959719, 16964244, 16959868, 16959699, 16960980, 16959955, 16960025, 16960037, 16963127, 16960580, 16963893, 16960415], "description": "Last week, we visited the city to find further signs of recovery as Detroit moves out from under budgetary oversight.", "descendants": 167, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/30/us/detroit-come-back-budget.html", "text": ["\nLast week, we visited the city to find further signs of recovery as Detroit moves out from under budgetary oversight.\n", "For a while, Detroit was known for vacant, crumbling homes and rock-bottom house prices.

White is walking or flying, red is Mages Guild teleports, blue is Almsivi/Divine Intervention spells, yellow is travel by boat/silt strider and green is Recalls.\nTotal Recall\nMark/Recall are a pair of spells in Morrowind that allow the player to teleport around the game world. Casting Mark remembers a given place and Recall teleports the player to the last position the Mark was cast. Only one Mark can be active at a given time: casting it again removes the previous Mark.\nImagine casting Mark at the beginning of a dungeon (unlike Skyrim, Morrowind dungeons don't have a quick shortcut back to the start of the dungeon from its end) and teleporting there, or placing a Mark next to an NPC providing transport services. This could shave a considerable amount of time from the route.\nThere are several questions here. Firstly, given a route, what's the most efficient arrangement of Mark and Recall casts for it? Secondly, can we change the optimiser to take into account the Mark/Recall spells? The most optimal route through the quest graph might not be the most optimal when Mark/Recall spells are used.\nSingle Mark\nFor now, imagine we have already settled on a route and can only place a Mark once in the game, in fact only at one node in the quest graph (and not anywhere on the route between nodes). What's the best place for it?\nSince we have a matrix of fastest node-to-node travel times, given a Mark position, at each node in the route we can decide whether we want to proceed to the next node directly or by first teleporting to the Mark and then going to the next node. Try placing a Mark at each the nodes in the route and see which one gives the fastest overall time:\ndef get_best_mark_position(route):\n    return min(\n        # can't use the mark until we've placed it\n        (sum(get_node_distance(r1, r2) for r1, r2 in zip(route[:i], route[1:i]))\n         + sum(\n            # after placing the mark, we have a choice of recalling to it and going to the next node\n            # or going to the next node directly\n            min(get_node_distance(r, r2), get_node_distance(r1, r2)) for r1, r2 in zip(route[i:], route[i + 1:])),\n         i, r) for i, r in enumerate(route)\n    )\n\nI ran that and found out that by far the best position for a single Mark was right at the questgiver who's standing next to the Mages Guild teleport. This makes a lot of sense: a Recall to the Mages Guild gives the player instant access to 4 cities. Coupled with Intervention spells, this lets the player reach essentially any town in the game within a matter of minutes, if not seconds.\nMultiple Marks\nNow, again, given a single route through the quests, let's allow the player to place multiple Marks so that they can Recall to the last one they placed.\nI first tried the same idea that I did for the route optimiser: take multiple possible arrangements of Marks (basically a Boolean array of the same length as the route that determines whether, at each node, we place a Mark there or not after we visit it), mutate each one (by randomly adding or removing Marks) and score it (sum up the decreased travel costs by considering at each node whether it's better to proceed to the next node directly or via a previous Mark).\nI let this run for a while but it wasn't giving good results, quickly getting stuck in local minima. A big problem with this approach was that it didn't consider placing Marks in places visited between nodes, which excluded strategies like placing a Mark at the beginning of a dungeon (while a door to the dungeon is a point in the travel graph, it isn't a point in the quest graph).\nTo do that, I'd have to have a matrix of best travel times between each pair of nodes in the travel graph, not just the quest graph. Given how long my implementation of Dijkstra took to create the matrix for 100 nodes, I wasn't going to get away with reusing it.\nSpeeding things up\nFloyd-Warshall is the nuclear option of pathfinding algorithms. Instead of finding shortest paths from a single source like Dijkstra would, it finds the shortest paths between any two vertices in the graph. Not only that, but it does in \\( \\Theta(V^3) \\), independently of the number of edges, making it perfect for dense graphs.\nIt took about 15 minutes to run my Python implementation of Floyd-Warshall on the coalesced 700-node graph. But this wasn't enough. I realised that coalescing vertices in the same in-game cell to a single one was giving strange results, too: for example, each node had an Almsivi/Divine Intervention edge towards the nearest Temple/Imperial Cult Shrine that has a weight considerably larger than zero (due to the fact that the central vertex for that cell was far away from the actual teleportation destination) and I was wondering if that could be skewing the route.\nI hence decided to rerun the route planner on the full unprocessed 6500-node graph and rewrote the Floyd-Warshall implementation in C++. It still took 15 minutes to run it, but this time it was on the whole graph. Most of this time, in fact, was spent loading the input and writing the output matrices, since I serialised those into text and not binary.\nAnd by that point I was on a roll anyway and rewrote the route planner in C++ as well. The Python program would now instead export the quest node distance matrix and the dependency graph to a text file. I didn't perform detailed measurements, but it definitely became a couple of orders of magnitude faster.\nAdding Mark/Recall awareness to the optimizer\nI tried rerunning the Mark/Recall planner on the fully expanded route (which enumerates each vertex on the travel graph) but by this point, it was getting more and more clear that simply maintaining a Mark at any Mages Guild teleporter was a really good option that was difficult to improve on. \n\nThis is a slightly trippy picture, but it's basically a contour plot that shows the average travel time (in real seconds, assuming a travel speed of about 750 units per second, which is achievable with an artifact that I'll talk about later) to any node in the quest graph from any point in the travel graph, interpolated using nearest-neighbour on pixels that didn't map to any points on the travel graph. I also added a travel cost of 5 seconds to public transport and Mages Guild teleporters. This was to account for the time spent in the game's UI as well as to nudge the optimiser into flailing less around multiple towns.\nStrictly speaking, I should have actually calculated the average time at each pixel, but this picture is good enough. The colour map here ranges from blue (smallest average travel time) to green (largest). For example, Vivec (south of the game map) has the largest average travel times to any point of interest in the route. This is because the Temple of Vivec (one possible destination of an Almsivi Intervention spell) is on the other side of the city from other transport modes (boats/silt striders/Mages Guild) and so anyone near Vivec would have to first teleport to the Temple and then walk across the city to continue their journey.\nOn the other hand, despite being basically a wasteland, the southeast corner of the map has good travel connections: this is because a Divine Intervention spell takes the player to Wolverine Hall on the east side, right next door to the Mages Guild.\nSilent Pilgrimage\nThere's a cool quest in Morrowind's Temple questline that involves the player completing a pilgrimage from the southernmost part of the game map to the northernmost. Sounds easy, right? Well, the only problem is that the player can't speak to anyone during the pilgrimage, which means the player can't use any public transport or Mages Guild teleports.\nThe honest way to do this is to actually walk or levitate the whole distance, which would take a few minutes even with Speed-increasing spells. The mostly-honest way to do this would be casting Divine/Almsivi Intervention spells in strategic places that would teleport the player part of the way between the spheres of influence of different Temples/Imperial Cult shrines. The dishonest way would be casting a Mark at the shrine during a previous visit and simply Recalling there when the pilgrimage starts.\nHowever, the first version of the route planner wasn't really aware of that quest. I had a \"Set Mark at Sanctus Shrine\" graph node and a \"Do the Sanctus Shrine quest\" node, but the optimiser wasn't encouraged to put them close together. In the best route it had come up with, those two nodes were far apart and about 3/4 of the route was with the Mark stuck at the Shrine.\nHence, if we want to maintain a Mark at a Mages Guild, we also have to juggle that with having a Mark at the Sanctus Shrine in order to complete the Silent Pilgrimage. So the question now was kind of an inverse one: given that we can teleport to a Guild at any time (except for when the Mark is at the Shrine and so we'd get teleported there instead), what's the best route through the game quests?\nI decided to produce two travel graphs: when there's a recall edge to a Mages Guild (it doesn't matter which one, since we can almost instantaneously teleport to any of them once we're there) and when there's a recall edge to the Sanctus Shrine.\nThe optimiser would get these two versions of the node-to-node distance matrix as well as the instructions specifying which matrix to use when. That way, it could also try to exploit the Mark in the northern part of the game map.\nThe best route it could come up with (not counting time spent in dialogue, combat, training or getting all required items/money at the start at the game) now took about 2500 seconds of real time, which looked quite promising.\nPropylon Chambers\nThere's a mode of transport in Morrowind that I hadn't mentioned at all: Propylon Chambers. They're located inside 10 ancient Dark Elf strongholds that are scattered roughly in a circle around the map. Each stronghold has a Propylon Index that's hidden somewhere in the game world, and discovering a given stronghold's Index allows the player to travel to that stronghold from either of the two adjacent to it. \n\n(from http://stuporstar.sarahdimento.com/other-mods/books-of-vvardenfell/key-to-the-dunmer-strongholds/)\nCan they be useful here? After looking at their placement, it sadly doesn't seem so. Firstly, there are very few strongholds that are closer to quest objectives than ordinary towns and secondly, their Indices are often in inconvenient places (for example, the Rotheran Index is located in Rotheran itself).\nBut perhaps it's worth including Propylon Chambers in the route anyway? To test that, I assumed that the player has all Propylon indices from the beginning and regenerated the travel graph with the addition of teleportation between adjacent Dunmer strongholds. This would provide a lower bound on the route length and show whether there is enough time saving to make getting any of the Indices worthwhile.\nTurns out, there really isn't. The best route without Propylon Chambers takes about 2500 seconds, whereas including them improves the route by only two minutes. There are a few places the optimiser decided to exploit this method of teleportation:\n\nWhen performing quests around Suran, going to Marandus and teleporting to Berandas in order to get the Boots of the Apostle in that stronghold.\nThen teleporting from Berandas to Falensarano on the eastern part of the game map to get Ring of the Wind from the cave nearby as well as (later on) deliver an item to a mine.\nTeleporting to Valenvaryon several times for easier access to the island north of the map.\nTeleporting from Hlormaren (a stronghold west of Balmora) to Falasmaryon where the Marksman master trainer lives.\nTeleporting from Berandas to Rotheran close to the end of the route to grab the Ice Blade of the Monarch (located in that stronghold).\n\nGiven that simulating actually getting the Indices would also be a pain (I'd have to keep track of the optimal travel time between any two quest nodes for when the player has any combination of indices out of \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\)), I decided to skip them for now.\nOpening gambit and various exploits\nThere are a few things that are worth doing at the beginning of the game to ensure a smooth progression through the route as well as raise enough money to pay our way through training and some faction quests.\nI'd use enchantments for most of the in-game activities, including dealing damage, teleporting and movement. Enchantments are spells that can be put on equipment. They require a soul gem to produce, which determines how much charge the item will have, but enchanted items recharge over time, don't use up player's Magicka reserves and spells cast from them can't fail and are instantaneous. This means that teleporting takes a few seconds faster since we don't need to wait for the cast animation, but more importantly, casts can't be interrupted by someone hitting the player.\nThe items enchanted with all three types of teleportation (Divine/Almsivi intervention and Recall) are easily obtained at the beginning of the game: the first two during Edwinna Elbert's initial questline and the final one can be bought from a merchant in Caldera. I hence changed the optimiser a bit to always have these two starting nodes (Ajira and Edwinna's Mages Guild quests) at the beginning of the route and would do some more preparation as part of these before proceeding.\nDealing damage\nI had played around with various ways of dealing damage to NPCs. I first thought of using Blunt weapons, since the player would have to train that skill anyway and one of the best Blunt weapons has to be acquired as a part of an Imperial Cult quest, but it still takes several swings to kill anyone with it, since the player can miss, especially at lower skill levels.\nThen I remembered about the Drain Health enchantment: it reduces the target's maximum health by a given number of points. It's supposed to be used as a cheap way to weaken the enemy, but it can also be exploited. If one casts Drain Health 100pt on someone, even for one second, they will die if they have fewer than 100 hit points. Paired with a 100-point Weakness to Magicka effect, this allows for a cheap way to kill anybody with fewer than 200 hit points, which is an overwhelming majority of game characters.\nMovement\nDespite all the teleportation, there still is a lot of walking to be done in the game. While the character will have access to Fortify Speed potions, I only wanted to use them for long movement segments, since making enough of them to cover the whole route would take too much time.\nThankfully, there is an artifact in the game that gives the player a constant Fortify Speed effect: Boots of Blinding Speed. They boost the player's speed by 200 points (essentially tripling it) at the expense of blinding (it's in the name) the player. The blinding effect can be resisted: if the player has a Resist Magicka spell active for the split second when they put the boots on, the effect is nullified.\nMoreover, levitation is important, since it allows the player to bypass various obstacles as well as avoid annoying enemies. Due to the way levitation speed is calculated (the main component is the sum of player's Speed and the levitation effect magnitude), 1 point of Levitation is sufficient for the player to start flying and it's cheaper to increase speed by manipulating the character's Speed attribute. 1 point of Levitation for about 90 seconds would be another enchantment.\nUnlock, frenzy\nChests and doors in Morrowind can have a lock with a level ranging from 1 to 100. Hence, we'd need to also enchant a piece of clothing with Open 100pt.\nThere are quite a few times in the route where we need to kill someone who's not attacking us without attracting the guards' attention (like when doing Morag Tong assassinations before the actual quest starts). One way to do it is taunting the NPC until they attack, which takes time and needs a moderately high Speechcraft skill. Luckily, there's a magic effect for that, too. Frenzy increases the Fight rating of an NPC and 100pt for 1 second is enough to make them attack the player. When the effect wears off, they don't stop attacking and can be slain in self defence without legal issues.\nAlchemy feedback loop and fundraising\nWhen a player creates a potion in Morrowind, their chance of success as well as the potion's strength, duration and value is partially governed by the player's Intelligence attribute.\nThe player can also create a potion that boosts their Intelligence attribute.\nDo you see how the game can be broken with this? There's no limit on how many potions the player can consume per second and there's no cap on the player's Intelligence. Hence we can have all our monetary problems taken care of by exploiting this and repeatedly creating stronger and stronger Intelligence potions to sell. Not only that, but we can also use this to create Restore Health potions that restore player's health faster than anybody can damage it as well as use the Intelligence boost to create enchanted items manually (instead of paying a specialist to do it). Finally, we can also create Fortify Speed potions that increase the player's raw speed.\nThere are merchants in Morrowind that restock some of their ingredients as soon as the player stops trading with them and lots of them sell ingredients for Fortify Intelligence and Restore Health potions.\nWe need about 75000 gold pieces to get through the game, including all training and faction quests. Luckily, there's a merchant in the game that has 5000 gold in his inventory and buys items at face value. My tests showed I needed about 150 Health potions to get me through the game, so I'd sell any extra ones to the Creeper to get me to the target number.\nFortifying player's Speed (beyond the boost provided by the Boots) is more difficult: there are only two ingredients in the game that restock and provide the Fortify Speed attribute, Kagouti Hide and Shalk Resin. However, they are quite expensive (52 gold pieces in total for the two) and also have a Drain Fatigue side effect (which makes the player lose consciousness when their Fatigue is close to zero). Hence they have to be paired with another two ingredients that have a Restore Fatigue effect.\nFinal route\nHere's the final route that I came up with: it opens with the sequence of money-making and enchantments that I had described before and then continues with the list of things to do that was produced by the optimiser. This initial sequence took me about 28 minutes to complete and the rest of the route is located here. I also uploaded the route that assumes the player can use all Propylon Chambers here.\n\nCreate the character (build). Steal the Limeware Platter from the Census & Excise office before leaving and pick up the Ring of Healing from the barrel on the way.\nGive the ring to Fargoth to boost relationship with Arrille. Go there, sell the platter, buy a Resist Magicka Spell, 2 Drathis' Winter Guest scrolls and an Iron Warhammer.\nOn the way to the silt strider, grab the 4 types of mushrooms (needed for Ajira's first quest). Take the silt strider to Balmora.\nJoin the Mages Guild, take all supplies from the chest and take the Ceramic Bowl from Ranis Athrys' table. Go downstairs to Estirdalin and make a spell of Resist Magicka 100% on Self. Hand in the first Ajira quest. Teleport to Caldera Mages Guild.\nSteal the alchemy set from the tower in the Guild as well as 1 Dreugh \nWax (needed for the Seven Graces quest).\nGo north-west towards Gnaar Mok to meet Pemenie. Kill her with a combination of Thunder Fist (Nord racial power), the Drathis' scrolls and the Warhammer.\nUse the Fortify Willpower and Restore Magicka potions from the supplies chest to successfully cast Resist Magicka spell and equip the Boots. Use the Almsivi Intervention scroll to go to Ald-Ruhn.\nGo to the Mages Guild, take all supplies from the chest there.\nBuy 2 Mark scrolls from Tanar Llervi (she sells one at a time but they restock after leaving the Barter menu).\nTake Mages Guild teleport to Balmora, place a Mark while facing Masalinie Merian (Guild teleporter).\nDo all remaining Ajira quests:\n\nMake sure to steal the Grand, the Large and the two Common Soul gems as well as the Platter and any other Soul Gem (needed as a donation for a Temple quest) during the second quest.\nFlowers: Willow Anther and Heather can be bought from Ajira herself. The other two can be stolen from Millie Hastien's shop. On the way there, sell the Platter to Ra'Virr next door.\nSell all rewards (potions) back to Ajira to have roughly 1000 gold for the next part.\n\nMages Guild teleport to Sadrith Mora, Go to Aunius Autrus in the Imperial Shrine.\nAlchemy loop time!\n\nUse all money to continuously buy 10 Ash Yam, 5 Bloat and 5 Netch Leather from Aunius Autrus (should roughly end up with 260, 130 and 130 of each, respectively).\nUse all Bloat and half of Ash Yams to make Intelligence potions, drink them all.\nUse all Netch Leather and Ash Yams to make Intelligence potions, sell enough to Aunius to get all his money, drink the rest.\nGo to Scelian Plebo and buy 10 Saltrice and 10 Marshmerrow 30 times.\nMake 300 Restore Health potions with these ingredients. Sell enough Health potions to Scelian to get all his money.\n\nBuy Drain Blood (has the Drain Health effect) and Frenzying Touch (has the Frenzy Humanoid effect) from Uleni Heleran in the Mages Guild on the way back.\nTeleport to Balmora, Almsivi Scroll to the Temple.\nGo to Nalcarya of White Haven. Buy 1 diamond (future Thieves Guild quest) and 4 Daedra Hearts (future Temple quest), sell her enough potions to drain her of money.\nGo to Millie Hastien next door. Buy 1 Exquisite Amulet, 1 Exquisite Ring, 1 Extravagant Pants and an Extravagant Belt.\nBack to Balmora MG, buy spells from Marayn Dren: Levitate, Ondusi's Open Door, Dire Weakness to Magicka.\nWhilst still under the effect of Intelligence potions, make the following enchantments:\n\nExquisite Amulet: Weakness to Magicka 100% on Touch, Drain Health 100% on Touch (use the stolen Grand Soul Gem).\nExpensive Belt: Levitate 1pt 90s on Self (use the stolen Greater Soul Gem)\nExquisite Ring: Open 100pt on Touch (Common Soul Gem)\nExpensive Pants: Frenzy Humanoid 100pt on Touch (Common Soul Gem)\n\nDo hotkeying. I prefer having the Amulet on 1, Belt on 7, Ring on 8 and Pants on 9.\nWhilst still under the effect of Intelligence potions, teleport to Sadrith Mora.\nBuy 100 Shalk Resin and 100 Kagouti hide from Pierlette Rostorard (will need to sell her Health potions a couple of times in order to afford the ingredients).\nBuy 100 Hound Meat and 100 Scuttle from Threvul Serethi.\nMake 100 potions of Fortify Speed (+ Restore Fatigue) from these 4 ingredients.  Alchemy should be slightly beyond 70 by this point (requirement for some Guild promotions). Hotkey Speed potions to 2.\nRecall and teleport to Caldera. Sell Restore Health potions to Creeper until have about 75000 gold. Hotkey remaining ones to 3.\nRecall, buy 6 Drathis' Winter Guest scrolls from Galbedir and buy Chronicles of Nchuleft from Dorisa Darvel, then steal a Dwemer Tube from Vorar Helas' house.\nRecall, teleport to Ald-Ruhn and do all Edwinna Elbert quests up to and including Dwemer Tube. Should be rewarded with the Almsivi and Divine Intervention amulets. Hotkey those to 4 and 5, respectively.\nProceed as per the rest of the route.\n\nFinally, there are several NPCs that have to be killed as part of the run and have to be damaged first before they can be killed with the Amulet, either with the Drathis' scrolls or with the Iron Warhammer/Skull Crusher when it's picked up:\n\nRelas Arothan has one Sanguine Item required for extra Morag Tong reputation.\nLorbumol gro-Aglakh needs to be killed as part of the Fighters Guild questline. While he has 199 health, he has some natural magic resistance, decreasing the effect of the amulet.\nBurub gra-Bamog also has some natural resistance to Magicka.\nOrvas Dren, brother of the Duke and head of the local criminal syndicate, has to be killed as part of the House Hlaalu questline and has 250 hit points.\nVarus Vantinius is the current head of the Imperial Legion and has to be killed in a duel to finish that faction's questline.\n\nConclusion\nI think that's it! The code to produce most of this is on my GitHub, together with the code from the previous set of articles. One day I might even actually record myself trying to follow this route, but I'm sure actually planning it out is more fun that running it.\nFinally, feel free to follow me on Twitter at twitter.com/mildbyte!\n", "Last time, I showed a way to generate a decent route through the quest graph as well as came up with a rough character progression that can be used to quickly complete all faction questlines in Morrowind.", "Today, I'll analyse Mark/Recall and other miscellaneous transport modes, deal with an interesting Temple quest, showcase the final route and finally publish the code for the route planner."], "title": "Planning a Morrowind all-faction speedrun with simulated annealing, part 3", "by": "mildbyte", "score": 95, "time": 1525093442, "top_comment": {"kids": [16961416], "parent": 16958216, "text": "That was a lot of fun to read.<p>I am finally getting to the point in my programming abilities where I have the confidence to solve problems like this.<p>&quot;throw something together&quot; never is that easy, but its getting easier.", "by": "mkirklions", "time": 1525114267, "type": "comment", "id": 16961192}, "type": "story", "id": 16958216}, "160": {"kids": [16960849, 16960377, 16960572, 16964696, 16960409, 16963162, 16960307, 16960401, 16960864, 16961422, 16962452, 16959939, 16964496, 16960370, 16960684, 16960308, 16962066, 16961040, 16961659, 16962078, 16962195, 16961642, 16962951, 16961066, 16960516, 16963979, 16960987, 16960347, 16963159, 16962373, 16963233, 16959864, 16960245, 16961718, 16960833, 16964098, 16962102], "description": "LLCs are the entity of choice for many small teams, side projects, and bootstrapped businesses.", "descendants": 201, "url": "https://stripe.com/blog/atlas-llc?c", "text": ["A complete payments platform engineered for\u00a0growth.", "\n  Today, we\u2019re adding support for creating a limited liability company (LLC) with Stripe Atlas.

The problem is: \u201cOver the course of one year, a drug dog is rewarded for responding to the odor of marijuana hundreds, if not thousands of times,\u201d says Barry Cooper, a former DEA agent. \u201cThe trained behavior of alerting to marijuana is imprinted so deep in the canine\u2019s psyche, it\u2019s impossible to erase.\u201d", "\u201cYou can\u2019t retrain dogs when it comes to marijuana,\u201d adds James Woodford, a forensic chemist who created and patented the odor of cocaine that serves as the industry standard when it comes to training dogs to sniff out the substance. (The government wouldn\u2019t allow him to do the same for weed because it\u2019s a naturally occuring odor, whereas cocaine is odorless until its fermented in a human environment, which, of course, is totally gross.) \u201cSay you always use marijuana stored in a Ziploc bag while training a dog, they\u2019ll start alerting to the smell of Ziploc bags. There\u2019s something called extinction training, where you train them not to alert to the bag, but you can\u2019t do that with marijuana. Illegal and legal weed smell the same. As a matter of fact, dogs usually get more training on marijuana than they do other drugs because of its prevalence and the way law enforcement has traditionally approached policing marijuana as a priority.\u201d", "The silver lining, though: Police officers can no longer use drug dogs to support their searches when the smell of weed is the only thing constituting probable cause, at least in Colorado, where this became the rule of law last summer, more than two years after weed was legalized in the state. \u201cAgain, since legal marijuana gives off the same odor as the illegal stuff, that kills the probable cause aspect of it,\u201d Woodford explains. \u201cCops have done a lot of lying about the odor of marijuana. In my opinion, cops will write their reports and use drug dogs to support their searches after the fact, so even if they don\u2019t end up finding any marijuana in a state where it\u2019s not legal, the cop will say, \u2018I smelled the marijuana, and the dog did too!\u2019 to make sure they\u2019re in the clear when it comes to probable cause.

Consider the very different trajectories of surgical anesthesia and antiseptics, both of which were discovered in the nineteenth century. The first public demonstration of anesthesia was in 1846. The Boston surgeon Henry Jacob Bigelow was approached by a local dentist named William Morton, who insisted that he had found a gas that could render patients insensible to the pain of surgery. That was a dramatic claim. In those days, even a minor tooth extraction was excruciating. Without effective pain control, surgeons learned to work with slashing speed. Attendants pinned patients down as they screamed and thrashed, until they fainted from the agony. Nothing ever tried had made much difference. Nonetheless, Bigelow agreed to let Morton demonstrate his claim.", "On October 16, 1846, at Massachusetts General Hospital, Morton administered his gas through an inhaler in the mouth of a young man undergoing the excision of a tumor in his jaw. The patient only muttered to himself in a semi-conscious state during the procedure. The following day, the gas left a woman, undergoing surgery to cut a large tumor from her upper arm, completely silent and motionless. When she woke, she said she had experienced nothing at all.", "Four weeks later, on November 18th, Bigelow published his report on the discovery of \u201cinsensibility produced by inhalation\u201d in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal. Morton would not divulge the composition of the gas, which he called Letheon, because he had applied for a patent. But Bigelow reported that he smelled ether in it (ether was used as an ingredient in certain medical preparations), and that seems to have been enough. The idea spread like a contagion, travelling through letters, meetings, and periodicals. By mid-December, surgeons were administering ether to patients in Paris and London. By February, anesthesia had been used in almost all the capitals of Europe, and by June in most regions of the world.", "There were forces of resistance, to be sure. Some people criticized anesthesia as a \u201cneedless luxury\u201d; clergymen deplored its use to reduce pain during childbirth as a frustration of the Almighty\u2019s designs. James Miller, a nineteenth-century Scottish surgeon who chronicled the advent of anesthesia, observed the opposition of elderly surgeons: \u201cThey closed their ears, shut their eyes, and folded their hands. . . . They had quite made up their minds that pain was a necessary evil, and must be endured.\u201d Yet soon even the obstructors, \u201cwith a run, mounted behind\u2014hurrahing and shouting with the best.\u201d Within seven years, virtually every hospital in America and Britain had adopted the new discovery.", "Sepsis\u2014infection\u2014was the other great scourge of surgery. It was the single biggest killer of surgical patients, claiming as many as half of those who underwent major operations, such as a repair of an open fracture or the amputation of a limb. Infection was so prevalent that suppuration\u2014the discharge of pus from a surgical wound\u2014was thought to be a necessary part of healing."], "title": "Slow ideas (2013)", "by": "cromano", "score": 62, "time": 1525145897, "top_comment": {"kids": [16966739], "parent": 16964431, "text": "&gt; Some people criticized anesthesia as a \u201cneedless luxury\u201d; clergymen deplored its use to reduce pain during childbirth as a frustration of the Almighty\u2019s designs.<p>It\u2019s become fashionable to take potshots at Christianity, justified or otherwise.<p>From a post on internationalskeptics.com[1]<p>&gt; British science historian Colin A.

Right there in Article I, Section 8 you can see it among the fewer than 20 items set forth for what the Congress is supposed to do:  &quot;The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States . . . To borrow Money . . . To regulate Commerce . . . To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization . . . To Coin Money . . . To provide for the punishment of Counterfeiting . . .

And To make Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.&quot;<p>I elided a few of the enumerated powers but the above sets forth the great majority of them.<p>Thus, while it might be and often is argued that copyright protection does not actually achieve the things ascribed to it (promoting creative works, protecting artists\u2019 rights in their creative works, etc.), the fact is that our laws are profoundly to the contrary: the idea of promoting the progress of science and useful arts via copyright protection (and patent protection) is right there among the <i>fundamentals</i> defining the essence of the legislative power of the federal government. And, to be listed at all among such powers is in itself profound because the states that formed the United States and ultimately ratified the constitution as a compact among them were jealous not to give any more authority to the federal government than was absolutely necessary.<p>That authority was granted only on the biggest of issues and was checked and balanced by and among the legislative power (Article I), the executive power (Article II), and the judicial power (Article III).<p>And yet there it stands: the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts, &quot;by securing for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to their respective Writings&quot;. Right there among the powers to print money, to declare war, to lay and collect taxes, to establish federal courts, and the like.<p>And <i>that</i> is why it was so utterly reprehensible when in 1998 the Congress took existing copyright terms that were to have run for 75 years and retroactively made them 95 years. Yes, the 1923 copyrights were to have expired in 1998 and, here we are, 20 years later, grateful to have them come into the public domain at last.<p>And in what sense did this retroactive copyright extension serve to promote the progress of science and useful arts? Well, in no sense at all. It imposed new rules retroactively. It provided for absurdly long lengths of copyright protection. It had no bearing at all on the idea of promoting the arts. As such, it constituted nothing more than a crude exercise of naked power utterly divorced from the <i>principled</i> reason for having copyright protection at all.<p>I believe in the value of copyright protection. I think there are excellent arguments to be made in its favor. But the cause of copyright protection was not promoted by the 1998 extension. It was significantly set back because people looking at what that Congress did are rightly revolted by the cronyism that cynically gave special favors to a privileged few and, suffering from the pain thereby inflicted on those who were needlessly burdened by completely arbitrary restrictions on being able to use works that deserved to be in the public domain, concluded that copyright protection itself is a great evil burdening society for no good purpose.<p>To repeat, <i>principled</i> application of the law is vital to a free society.

Let's jump right in and use it to do this.", "As you can see in the \"Output After Training\", it works!!! Before I describe processes, I recommend playing around with the code to get an intuitive feel for how it works. You should be able to run it \"as is\" in an ipython notebook (or a script if you must, but I HIGHLY recommend the notebook). Here are some good places to look in the code: \n\n\u2022 Compare l1 after the first iteration and after the last iteration. \n\u2022 Check out the \"nonlin\" function. This is what gives us a probability as output.\n\u2022 Check out how l1_error changes as you iterate. \n\u2022 Take apart line 36. Most of the secret sauce is here. \n\u2022 Check out line 39. Everything in the network prepares for this operation. \n\n\n\nLet's walk through the code line by line.\n\nRecommendation: open this blog in two screens so you can see the code while you read it. That's kinda what I did while I wrote it. :)\nLine 01:\nThis imports numpy, which is a linear algebra library. This is our only dependency.\n\nLine 04:\nThis is our \"nonlinearity\". While it can be several kinds of functions, this nonlinearity maps a function called a \"sigmoid\". A sigmoid function maps any value to a value between 0 and 1. We use it to convert numbers to probabilities. It also has several other desirable properties for training neural networks.\n\n\nLine 05:\nNotice that this function can also generate the derivative of a sigmoid (when deriv=True). One of the desirable properties of a sigmoid function is that its output can be used to create its derivative. If the sigmoid's output is a variable \"out\", then the derivative is simply out * (1-out). This is very efficient. \n\nIf you're unfamililar with derivatives, just think about it as the slope of the sigmoid function at a given point (as you can see above, different points have different slopes). For more on derivatives, check out this  derivatives tutorial from Khan Academy.\n\nLine 10:\nThis initializes our input dataset as a numpy matrix. Each row is a single \"training example\". Each column corresponds to one of our input nodes. Thus, we have 3 input nodes to the network and 4 training examples.  \n\nLine 16:\nThis initializes our output dataset. In this case, I generated the dataset horizontally (with a single row and 4 columns) for space. \".T\" is the transpose function. After the transpose, this y matrix has 4 rows with one column. Just like our input, each row is a training example, and each column (only one) is an output node. So, our network has 3 inputs and 1 output.\n\nLine 20:\nIt's good practice to seed your random numbers. Your numbers will still be randomly distributed, but they'll be randomly distributed in exactly the same way each time you train. This makes it easier to see how your changes affect the network.\n\nLine 23:\nThis is our weight matrix for this neural network. It's called \"syn0\" to imply \"synapse zero\". Since we only have 2 layers (input and output), we only need one matrix of weights to connect them. Its dimension is (3,1) because we have 3 inputs and 1 output. Another way of looking at it is that l0 is of size 3 and l1 is of size 1. Thus, we want to connect every node in l0 to every node in l1, which requires a matrix of dimensionality (3,1). :)\n\nAlso notice that it is initialized randomly with a mean of zero. There is quite a bit of theory that goes into weight initialization. For now, just take it as a best practice that it's a good idea to have a mean of zero in weight initialization.\n\nAnother note is that the \"neural network\" is really just this matrix. We have \"layers\" l0 and l1 but they are transient values based on the dataset. We don't save them. All of the learning is stored in the syn0 matrix.\n\nLine 25:\nThis begins our actual network training code. This for loop \"iterates\" multiple times over the training code to optimize our network to the dataset.\n\nLine 28:\nSince our first layer, l0, is simply our data. We explicitly describe it as such at this point. Remember that X contains 4 training examples (rows). We're going to process all of them at the same time in this implementation. This is known as \"full batch\" training. Thus, we have 4 different l0 rows, but you can think of it as a single training example if you want. It makes no difference at this point. (We could load in 1000 or 10,000 if we wanted to without changing any of the code).\n\nLine 29:\nThis is our prediction step. Basically, we first let the network \"try\" to predict the output given the input. We will then study how it performs so that we can adjust it to do a bit better for each iteration. \n\nThis line contains 2 steps. The first matrix multiplies l0 by syn0. The second passes our output through the sigmoid function. Consider the dimensions of each:\n(4 x 3) dot (3 x 1) = (4 x 1) \nMatrix multiplication is ordered, such the dimensions in the middle of the equation must be the same. The final matrix generated is thus the number of rows of the first matrix and the number of columns of the second matrix.\nSince we loaded in 4 training examples, we ended up with 4 guesses for the correct answer, a (4 x 1) matrix. Each output corresponds with the network's guess for a given input. Perhaps it becomes intuitive why we could have \"loaded in\" an arbitrary number of training examples. The matrix multiplication would still work out. :)\n\nLine 32:\nSo, given that l1 had a \"guess\" for each input. We can now compare how well it did by subtracting the true answer (y) from the guess (l1). l1_error is just a vector of positive and negative numbers reflecting how much the network missed.\n\nLine 36:\nNow we're getting to the good stuff! This is the secret sauce! There's a lot going on in this line, so let's further break it into two parts. \nFirst Part: The Derivative\n\nnonlin(l1,True)\n\n\n\nIf l1 represents these three dots, the code above generates the slopes of the lines below. Notice that very high values such as x=2.0 (green dot) and very low values such as x=-1.0 (purple dot) have rather shallow slopes. The highest slope you can have is at x=0 (blue dot). This plays an important role. Also notice that all derivatives are between 0 and 1.\n\n\nEntire Statement: The Error Weighted Derivative\n\nl1_delta = l1_error * nonlin(l1,True)\n\nThere are more \"mathematically precise\" ways than \"The Error Weighted Derivative\" but I think that this captures the intuition. l1_error is a (4,1) matrix. nonlin(l1,True) returns a (4,1) matrix. What we're doing is multiplying them \"elementwise\". This returns a (4,1) matrix l1_delta with the multiplied values. \n\nWhen we multiply the \"slopes\" by the error, we are reducing the error of high confidence predictions. Look at the sigmoid picture again! If the slope was really shallow (close to 0), then the network either had a very high value, or a very low value. This means that the network was quite confident one way or the other. However, if the network guessed something close to (x=0, y=0.5) then it isn't very confident. We update these \"wishy-washy\" predictions most heavily, and we tend to leave the confident ones alone by multiplying them by a number close to 0.\n\nLine 39:\nWe are now ready to update our network! Let's take a look at a single training example.\n\nIn this training example, we're all setup to update our weights. Let's update the far left weight (9.5).\nweight_update = input_value * l1_delta\n\nFor the far left weight, this would multiply 1.0 * the l1_delta. Presumably, this would increment 9.5 ever so slightly. Why only a small ammount? Well, the prediction was already very confident, and the prediction was largely correct. A small error and a small slope means a VERY small update. Consider all the weights. It would ever so slightly increase all three.\n\n\n\nHowever, because we're using a \"full batch\" configuration, we're doing the above step on all four training examples. So, it looks a lot more like the image above. So, what does line 39 do? It computes the weight updates for each weight for each training example, sums them, and updates the weights, all in a simple line. Play around with the matrix multiplication and you'll see it do this! \n\nTakeaways:\nSo, now that we've looked at how the network updates, let's look back at our training data and reflect. When both an input and a output are 1, we increase the weight between them. When an input is 1 and an output is 0, we decrease the weight between them. \n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;}\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;}\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;}\n.tg .tg-5rcs{font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;}\n.tg .tg-4kyz{font-size:20px;text-align:center;}\n\n\n\nInputs\nOutput\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\nThus, in our four training examples below, the weight from the first input to the output would consistently increment or remain unchanged, whereas the other two weights would find themselves both increasing and decreasing across training examples (cancelling out progress). This phenomenon is what causes our network to learn based on correlations between the input and output.\n\nPart 2: A Slightly Harder Problem\n\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;}\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;}\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;}\n.tg .tg-5rcs{font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;}\n.tg .tg-4kyz{font-size:20px;text-align:center}\n\n\n\nInputs\nOutput\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n\nConsider trying to predict the output column given the two input columns. A key takeway should be that neither columns have any correlation to the output. Each column has a 50% chance of predicting a 1 and a 50% chance of predicting a 0. \n\nSo, what's the pattern? It appears to be completely unrelated to column three, which is always 1. However, columns 1 and 2 give more clarity. If either column 1 or 2 are a 1 (but not both!) then the output is a 1. This is our pattern. \n\n\nThis is considered a \"nonlinear\" pattern because there isn't a direct one-to-one relationship between the input and output. Instead, there is a one-to-one relationship between a combination of inputs, namely columns 1 and 2.\n\n\n\nBelieve it or not, image recognition is a similar problem. If one had 100 identically sized images of pipes and bicycles, no individual pixel position would directly correlate with the presence of a bicycle or pipe. The pixels might as well be random from a purely statistical point of view. However, certain combinations of pixels are not random, namely the combination that forms the image of a bicycle or a person.\nOur Strategy\n In order to first combine pixels into something that can then have a one-to-one relationship with the output, we need to add another layer. Our first layer will combine the inputs, and our second layer will then map them to the output using the output of the first layer as input. Before we jump into an implementation though, take a look at this table.\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;}\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;}\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;}\n.tg .tg-5rcs{font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;}\n.tg .tg-4kyz{font-size:20px;text-align:center}\n\n\n\nInputs (l0)\nHidden Weights (l1)\nOutput (l2)\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n0.1\n0.2\n0.5\n0.2\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n0.2\n0.6\n0.7\n0.1\n1\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n0.3\n0.2\n0.3\n0.9\n1\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.3\n0.8\n0\n\n\n\n\nIf we randomly initialize our weights, we will get hidden state values for layer 1. Notice anything? The second column (second hidden node), has a slight correlation with the output already! It's not perfect, but it's there. Believe it or not, this is a huge part of how neural networks train. (Arguably, it's the only way that neural networks train.) What the training below is going to do is amplify that correlation. It's both going to update syn1 to map it to the output, and update syn0 to be better at producing it from the input!\n\n\nNote: The field of adding more layers to model more combinations of relationships such as this is known as \"deep learning\" because of the increasingly deep layers being modeled.\n3 Layer Neural Network:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef nonlin(x,deriv=False):\n\tif(deriv==True):\n\t    return x*(1-x)\n\n\treturn 1/(1+np.exp(-x))\n    \nX = np.array([[0,0,1],\n            [0,1,1],\n            [1,0,1],\n            [1,1,1]])\n                \ny = np.array([[0],\n\t\t\t[1],\n\t\t\t[1],\n\t\t\t[0]])\n\nnp.random.seed(1)\n\n# randomly initialize our weights with mean 0\nsyn0 = 2*np.random.random((3,4)) - 1\nsyn1 = 2*np.random.random((4,1)) - 1\n\nfor j in xrange(60000):\n\n\t# Feed forward through layers 0, 1, and 2\n    l0 = X\n    l1 = nonlin(np.dot(l0,syn0))\n    l2 = nonlin(np.dot(l1,syn1))\n\n    # how much did we miss the target value?\n    l2_error = y - l2\n    \n    if (j% 10000) == 0:\n        print \"Error:\" + str(np.mean(np.abs(l2_error)))\n        \n    # in what direction is the target value?\n    # were we really sure? if so, don't change too much.\n    l2_delta = l2_error*nonlin(l2,deriv=True)\n\n    # how much did each l1 value contribute to the l2 error (according to the weights)?\n    l1_error = l2_delta.dot(syn1.T)\n    \n    # in what direction is the target l1?\n    # were we really sure? if so, don't change too much.\n    l1_delta = l1_error * nonlin(l1,deriv=True)\n\n    syn1 += l1.T.dot(l2_delta)\n    syn0 += l0.T.dot(l1_delta)\n\n\n\n\nError:0.496410031903\nError:0.00858452565325\nError:0.00578945986251\nError:0.00462917677677\nError:0.00395876528027\nError:0.00351012256786\n\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;}\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;}\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;}\n.tg .tg-5rcs{font-weight:bold;font-size:20px; text-align:center; padding-left:20px; padding-right: 20px;}\n.tg .tg-4kyx{font-size:20px;text-align:center;font-weight:italic; padding-left:20px; padding-right: 20px;}\n.tg .tg-4kyz{font-size:20px;text-align:left; padding-left: 20px;}\n\n\n\nVariable\nDefinition\n\n\nX\nInput dataset matrix where each row is a training example\n\n\ny\nOutput dataset matrix where each row is a training example\n\n\nl0\nFirst Layer of the Network, specified by the input data\n\n\nl1\nSecond Layer of the Network, otherwise known as the hidden layer\n\n\nl2\nFinal Layer of the Network, which is our hypothesis, and should approximate the correct answer as we train.\n\n\nsyn0\nFirst layer of weights, Synapse 0, connecting l0 to l1.\n\n\nsyn1\nSecond layer of weights, Synapse 1 connecting l1 to l2.\n\n\nl2_error\nThis is the amount that the neural network \"missed\".\n\n\nl2_delta\nThis is the error of the network scaled by the confidence.

That's kinda what I did while I wrote it. :)\n\nEverything should look very familiar! It's really just 2 of the previous implementation stacked on top of each other. The output of the first layer (l1) is the input to the second layer. The only new thing happening here is on line 43.\n\nLine 43: uses the \"confidence weighted error\" from l2 to establish an error for l1. To do this, it simply sends the error across the weights from l2 to l1. This gives what you could call a \"contribution weighted error\" because we learn how much each node value in l1 \"contributed\" to the error in l2. This step is called \"backpropagating\" and is the namesake of the algorithm. We then update syn0 using the same steps we did in the 2 layer implementation.\n\nPart 3: Conclusion and Future Work\n\nMy Recommendation:\n\nIf you're serious about neural networks, I have one recommendation. Try to rebuild this network from memory. I know that might sound a bit crazy, but it seriously helps. If you want to be able to create arbitrary architectures based on new academic papers or read and understand sample code for these different architectures, I think that it's a killer exercise. I think it's useful even if you're using frameworks like Torch, Caffe, or Theano. I worked with neural networks for a couple years before performing this exercise, and it was the best investment of time I've made in the field (and it didn't take long). \n\nFuture Work\nThis toy example still needs quite a few bells and whistles to really approach the state-of-the-art architectures.

Early on, we learned that certain classes of performance issues are trivial to root cause. It\u2019s easy to spot I/O on the main thread, for example. In those cases, we found conventional Android performance profiling tools quite sufficient for debugging. \nMore complex investigations, however, were sometimes rendered inconclusive due to incomplete or inaccurate data. Some questions we initially struggled to answer included \u201cWhy are certain animations slow to start?\u201d and \u201cWhy is TextView inflation slow in some cases?\u201d After running into limitations of the Android Studio CPU profiler, we built Nanoscope, an internal tool to provide us with better method tracing.\nSince the implementation of our initial prototype, we\u2019ve been using and iterating on the internal tracer, and are now able to confidently debug those difficult performance issues. Among other discoveries, we\u2019ve since found that building animation hardware layers is more expensive than expected, and that TextView text autosizing is much slower if you don\u2019t use granularity.\nOur internal method tracer continues to provide us with unprecedented insight into the performance of our apps, so we\u2019ve decided to share that tool with the rest of the Android community. Today, we are excited to release Nanoscope: an extremely accurate method tracing tool for Android.\n1. Use nanoscope command to start tracing. 2. Explore flamegraph in the Nanoscope visualizer.\n\nMotivation\nWe understand the value of leveraging existing tools and believe that new tools warrant thorough justification, so before diving into how Nanoscope works, we\u2019ll take a look at Android Studio\u2019s performance tools and where they fell short for us.\nAndroid Studio method tracing\nLike Nanoscope, Android Studio provides method tracing functionality. The main blocker for us was the significant performance overhead introduced by Android Studio\u2019s method tracing instrumentation.\nLeft: Nanoscope tracing. Right: Android Studio method tracing. Time from click to beginning of animation.\nSome of our key transitions ran multiple orders of magnitude slower with Android Studio method tracing enabled. Any method tracing will slow down runtime performance a certain amount due to extra logging logic, but at this level of distortion, the resulting performance profiles were no longer an accurate representation of normal app usage and were not useful for our performance investigations.\nAndroid Studio method sampling\nIn addition to method tracing, Android Studio offers method sampling as an alternative that promises significantly reduced impact on runtime performance. We tested this feature out and it is indeed possible to sample with very little overhead by configuring the sampling frequency, but it comes with tradeoffs. At lower frequencies, fewer measurements are taken and thus the total overhead is reduced at the cost of precision, as depicted in Figure 1:\nFigure 1: Low Frequency Sampling\nThe app runs smoothly in this case but the trace is missing many important details. Higher frequencies produce a more complete trace, but require more measurements, increasing the impact on performance, depicted in Figure 2:\nFigure 2: High Frequency Sampling\nWith a production data feedback loop of around three weeks, it\u2019s important that we have an accurate understanding of our code\u2019s performance profile lest we discover three weeks after committing a fix that it failed to solve the issue or made things worse. We found that at any given frequency, Android Studio method sampling lacked either the detail or the accuracy that we required. At this point, we began to wonder if it was possible to have both.\n\u00a0\nNanscope design\nBefore building a prototype, the first decision to make was whether our tool would be trace or sample-based. To avoid any concerns around incomplete data, we landed on a trace-based implementation. We also theorized that an optimal sampling tool would be less efficient than an optimal tracing tool due to the fact that each sample needs to walk the entire stack while a trace measurement simply logs the current method identifier. \nThe solution we came to was an extremely low-overhead, trace-based tool that could give us the detail and accuracy required to confidently debug our performance issues. Early results from a prototype were promising and encouraged us to continue work on what would eventually become Nanoscope.\nThe level of performance we\u2019ve achieved with Nanoscope relies on deep integration with the operating system. To accomplish this, we implemented Nanoscope as a fork of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). This strategy also serves as Nanoscope\u2019s biggest barrier to entry for users as it requires a device running the custom operating system, but with full control over the OS, our strategy is quite simple:\n\nAllocate an array to hold our trace data.\nOn method entry:\n\nWrite the timestamp and method pointer to indicate a push to the call stack\n\n\nOn method exit:\n\nWrite the timestamp and a null pointer to indicate a pop from the call stack\n\n\n\nInterpreter\nOur first task was to instrument the interpreter. Luckily, all methods executed by the interpreter flow through a single method:\n\nWe\u2019ve added the TraceStart and TraceEnd methods to do the heavy minimal lifting of logging our trace data:\n\nWe first determine whether tracing is enabled for the thread by checking whether our trace data array exists. Then, we write a method identifier (or a nullptr for a pop) followed by the current timestamp, which is retrieved directly from a timer register for optimal performance.\nCompiler\nNot all Java methods are executed by the interpreter. Some methods are AOT or JIT-compiled into machine instructions and executed directly. In these cases, we could generate a call to our TraceStart/TraceEnd methods, but we avoid a jump by inlining the equivalent assembly instructions at the start and end of each compiled method. Below is the 64-bit assembly we generate for method entry:\n\nWe generate similar instructions for method exits and also include support for the 32-bit compiler.\nResults\nWe\u2019ve obsessed over minimizing the logic executed per method, and we\u2019re really proud of the results. While tracing, Nanoscope introduces only 20 nanoseconds of overhead per method and less than 10 percent total overhead in our startup sequence. In addition to the discoveries mentioned earlier, here are some example performance problems that we now understand in depth thanks to Nanoscope:\n\nWebViews are slow to initialize only the first time due to the initialization of Chromium.\nMuch of the time spent in Google Maps initialization is due to classloading.\nMenuView performs rebinding/layout/inflation on every click event (github issue).\n\nNanoscope\u2019s accuracy has also made it easy to categorize performance behavior locally instead of relying on averages of production measurements. We can now quickly answer the following questions, for example:\n\nWhat percent of the transition is spent in View-related operations?\nWhat percent of the transition is attributed to our platform libraries?\nWhat percent of the transition is spent inside RxJava?\n\nSince we\u2019ve begun using Nanoscope, distorted or missing data has no longer been an obstacle for us when debugging Android performance issues at Uber.\n\u00a0\nNext steps\nIf you want to learn more about the architecture, check out the wiki, and if you are interesting in improving your app\u2019s performance, please consider giving Nanoscope a try.\nThere are plenty of other interesting problems to tackle at Uber and we\u2019re hiring!\n\nAndroid Role\niOS Role\nBackend Role\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\nFilter by\n\n\n\r\n                                Post type                            \n\n\nubltangoportfolio\nPost\nPage\n\n\n\n\r\n                                Category                            \n\n\nGeneral Engineering\nArchitecture\nDevelopers\nMobile\nAI\nUber Data\nCulture\n\n\n\n\nSort by\n\n\r\n                                Title                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n               Relevance            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            Introducing Chameleon: A Global CMS from Uber Engineering                                                            \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            Introducing Chaperone: How Uber Engineering Audits Kafka End-to-End                                                            \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            Introducing the Driver API                                                            \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            An Uber Engineer Discusses Cash for India Growth and Beyond                                                            \n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            Scaling Infrastructure Management with Grail                                                            \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            NEAL, Uber\u2019s Open Source Language-Agnostic Linting Platform                                                            \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            SBNet: Leveraging Activation Block Sparsity for Speeding up Convolutional Neural Networks                                                            \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            COTA: Improving Uber Customer Care with NLP & Machine Learning                                                            \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            Welcoming the Era of Deep Neuroevolution                                                            \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            Navigating the Engineering Interview Process at Uber & Beyond                                                            \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            Gleaning Insights from Uber\u2019s Partner Activity Matrix with Genomic Biclustering and Machine Learning                                                            \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                            Engineering More Reliable Transportation with Machine Learning and AI at Uber                                                            \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Share173 Tweet15 Share Vote1 Reddit64 +1\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \"@context\" : \"http://schema.org\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \"@type\" : \"Person\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \"name\" : \"Leland Takamine\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t \t\t  \"url\" : \"https://eng.uber.com/author/leland-takamine/\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \"sameAs\" : [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  ]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeland TakamineLeland is a senior software engineer on Uber's Android Development team.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \"@context\" : \"http://schema.org\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \"@type\" : \"Person\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \"name\" : \"Brian Attwell\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t \t\t  \"url\" : \"https://eng.uber.com/author/brian-attwell/\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \"sameAs\" : [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  ]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrian AttwellStaff Software Engineer in MobileBrian Attwell is a staff software engineer on Uber\u2019s Mobile Platform team.

You can use it on the client-side for a GraphQL client application, server-side for a GraphQL server application, somewhere in between as a gateway, and also for other GraphQL related tools (e.g. monitoring). At the time of writing this tutorial, Apollo offers the richest and most popular ecosystem around GraphQL in JavaScript. There are other libraries for React applications out there, such as Relay and Urql, but they are only for React applications and not as popular as the Apollo Client which has the advantage of being framework agnostic.

Where is the subway?\n\r\nThe main subway tunnel runs under Central Parkway for two miles,\r\nbetween\r\nWalnut St. and an anonymous spot north of the Western Hills\r\nViaduct.\u00a0\r\nThree underground stations were built and still exist at Race St.,\r\nLiberty St., and\r\nBrighton's Corner.\u00a0 An extension of this tunnel under Walnut St.\r\nsouth\r\nthrough downtown with a station at Fountain Square was planned but\r\nnever\r\nbuilt.\u00a0 Additionally, several miles of surface running line were\r\ngraded\r\nand three of roughly a dozen planned above ground stations were\r\nbuilt.\u00a0\r\nSignificant portions of today's I-75 and the Norwood Lateral follow the\r\npath of the line.\u00a0 A stretch of I-71 near the Dana Ave.\r\ninterchange was built where the subway loop's eastern half was planned.\n\n2. When was it constructed?\r\n\r\nThe main subway tunnel was built in four contracts between 1920 and 1923.  A fifth subway contract paid for by the Central Parkway bond issue extended the subway in 1927 north from the Brighton Bridge to the portals still visible from I-75.  This means the subway section under Central Parkway forming the north edge of downtown is seven years older than the portals.       \r\n\r\n\n3. Can the tunnel still be used?\r\n\r\nYes.\u00a0 It has been continuously maintained and will likely be\r\nusable\r\nfor the next one hundred years, if not longer.\u00a0 The 2002 \"Metro Moves\"\r\nsales tax would\r\nhave\r\nfunded a rail transit network that planned to use the tunnel, but it\r\nwas\r\ndefeated by a 2-1 public vote.\n\r\n4.

Solutions have ranged from language-independent object models such as COM (Component Object Model) and CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) to VMs (virtual machines) designed to integrate languages, such as the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and CLR (Common Language Runtime). With software becoming ever more complex and hardware less homogeneous, the likelihood of a single language being the correct tool for an entire program is lower than ever. As modern compilers become more modular, there is potential for a new generation of interesting solutions.", "In 1961 the British company Stantec released a computer called the ZEBRA, which was interesting for a number of reasons, not least of which was its data flow-based instruction set. The ZEBRA was quite difficult to program with the full form of its native instruction set, so it also included a more conventional version, called Simple Code. This form came with some restrictions, including a limit of 150 instructions per program. The manual helpfully informs users that this is not a severe limitation, as it is impossible that someone would write a working program so complex that it would need more than 150 instructions.", "Today, this claim seems ludicrous. Even simple functions in a relatively low-level language such as C have more than 150 instructions once they are compiled, and most programs are far more than a single function. The shift from writing assembly code to writing in a higher-level language dramatically increased the complexity of programs that were possible, as did various software engineering practices.", "The trend toward increased complexity in software shows no sign of abating, and modern hardware creates new challenges. Programmers in the late 1990s had to target PCs at the low end that had an abstract model a lot like a fast PDP-11. At the high end, they would have encountered an abstract model like a very fast PDP-11, possibly with two to four (identical) processors. Now, mobile phones are starting to appear with eight cores with the same ISA (instruction set architecture) but different speeds, some other streaming processors optimized for different workloads (DSPs, GPUs), and other specialized cores.", "The traditional division between high-level languages representing the class that is similar to a human's understanding of the problem domain and low-level languages representing the class similar to the hardware no longer applies. No low-level language has semantics that are close to a programmable data-flow processor, an x86 CPU, a massively multithreaded GPU, and a VLIW (very long instruction word) DSP (digital signal processor). Programmers wanting to get the last bit of performance out of the available hardware no longer have a single language they can use for all probable targets.", "Similarly, at the other end of the abstraction spectrum, domain-specific languages are growing more prevalent. High-level languages typically trade generality for the ability to represent a subset of algorithms efficiently. More general-purpose high-level languages such as Java sacrifice the ability to manipulate pointers directly in exchange for providing the programmer with a more abstract memory model. Specialized languages such as SQL make certain categories of algorithms impossible to implement but make common tasks within their domain possible to express in a few lines."], "title": "The Challenge of Cross-Language Interoperability (2013)", "by": "mpweiher", "score": 45, "time": 1525200913, "top_comment": {"kids": [16974229, 16976615, 16974643], "parent": 16970202, "text": "\u201cWe are sorry ...<p>... but we have temporarily restricted your access to the Digital Library.

The Flapper, a magazine devoted to this new image of womanhood, used this description in 1922: \u201cBobbed hair, powder and rouge on the face; use of lipstick; \u2018plucked\u2019 eyebrows, low cut sleeveless bodice, [and] absence of corset.\u201d All these elements were in their own way revolutionary\u2014in earlier eras, heavy cosmetics were taboo, and clothing covered rather than revealed. But one aspect was left out: The flapper look was lean and androgynous, and maintaining that ideal often required a special \u201cflapper diet.\u201d", "Over the centuries and across cultures, the ideal female body type has fluctuated. In many Western cultures, the pre-flapper generation considered a certain plumpness a sign of health, and fashion called for full skirts. But social reformers and women\u2019s rights advocates had long been wary of abundant cloth, which could easily catch fire, and tight corsets, which could compress and deform women\u2019s torsos. Lighter, shorter dresses became ever more fashionable after World War I, as did comfortable clothing and relaxed social mores. Restrictions on dating, dancing, and sex loosened. The cosmetic changes reflected changing opinions on femininity, and the person who most epitomized the new era was the corsetless, cosmetic-wearing, free-spirited flapper.", "Yet other restrictions surfaced. Designers such as Coco Chanel popularized a slim silhouette. The bathroom scale (patented in 1916) became a household staple. Books, magazines, and the media began depicting fat as the result of insufficient willpower. While people have always dieted to fit their era\u2019s beauty standards, the new female silhouette was a departure from previous buxom ideals. \u201cThough the flapper image minimized breasts and hips, it radiated sensuality,\u201d writes historian Margaret A. Lowe. The slender silhouette seemed modern. Female curves seemed old-fashioned.", "Suddenly, raw vegetables were in vogue. In Lowe\u2019s study of the diet of Smith College students in the 1920s, she quoted a campus warden who noticed that consumption of potatoes had diminished, while students were eating more celery, tomatoes, and lettuce. Outside of Smith, people followed the Hollywood 18-Day Diet\u2014a prototype of modern fads. Inspired by the burgeoning film industry, they ate only oranges, grapefruit, toast, and eggs.", "But strict diets were no easier to follow back then than they are now. Yvonne Blue was a Chicago teenager who came of age in the 1920s. Her parents described her as \u201cthe personification of wild modern youth\u201d\u2014in other words, a flapper. In her diary, she recorded days of fasting and longing descriptions of the buttery grilled cheese and lemonade she denied herself. According to historian Joshua Zeitz, \u201cthe expectation that they starve themselves in pursuit of flapperdom [was] a very real dilemma for many young women in the 1920s.\u201d It didn\u2019t help that the decade introduced new processed treats like Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups, Good Humor ice cream, and Velveeta cheese.", "The actresses that young women imitated were thin\u2014or else. Slender stars such as Colleen Moore ate no potatoes, sweets, or butter. Though film was a newer medium, magazines extensively covered actresses\u2019 diets and struggles with weight. Clara Bow was scrutinized every time she put on weight, and Barbara La Marr, who epitomized flapperdom\u2019s wild side, died at age 29 from a combination of drug addiction and extreme dieting."], "title": "A new standard of beauty led to today\u2019s weight-loss regimens", "by": "samclemens", "score": 15, "time": 1525018168, "top_comment": {"kids": [16973514], "parent": 16952585, "text": "It&#x27;s interesting to compare official &quot;beauty standards&quot; (which flit around on the winds of fashion) with what gets published in lads&#x27; mags (which is quite consistently buxom women with trim waists and long hair).", "by": "taneq", "time": 1525223270, "type": "comment", "id": 16973261}, "type": "story", "id": 16952585}, "312": {"kids": [16973313, 16973525, 16976762, 16973252, 16974265, 16974990, 16973489, 16976624, 16973503, 16976760, 16983862, 16976013, 16974404, 16984612], "descendants": 72, "url": "https://tic.computer/", "title": "TIC-80, a fantasy computer to learn programming", "by": "zeveb", "score": 359, "time": 1525187554, "top_comment": {"kids": [16973358, 16973448, 16973397, 16973880, 16978697], "parent": 16967664, "text": "Maybe this is a good time to plug PICO-8 which describes itself as a &quot;fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs.&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lexaloffle.com&#x2F;pico-8.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lexaloffle.com&#x2F;pico-8.php</a><p>I don&#x27;t even know the difference between the two programs, but someone interested in TIC might also be interested in PICO.", "by": "hungariantoast", "time": 1525223981, "type": "comment", "id": 16973313}, "type": "story", "id": 16967664}, "313": {"title": "Front (YC S14) \u2013 Software Engineers \u2013 San Francisco, CA and Paris, France", "text": "At Front, we&#x27;re redefining work communication and collaboration with our shared inbox for teams.

Just one gremlin in one telescope\u2019s instrument, for example, or one underestimated error, is all it takes to explain the gap between the Hubble values. \u201cWhen you make these measurements, you account for everything that you know of, but of course there could be things we don\u2019t know of.

This method can be extended to the more-distant universe by climbing the \u201ccosmic distance ladder\u201d \u2014 using the brightness of Cepheids to calibrate the brightness of supernovas that can be seen from billions of light-years away.", "All of these measurements have uncertainties, of course.

", "\r\nIn casual conversations, citing a variation of the Peter Principle \u2014 the idea that managers tend to \"rise to the level of their incompetence\" \u2014 often draws a chuckle, especially among those who work for incompetent managers. But in Promotions and the Peter Principle (NBER Working Paper No. 24343) \r\nAlan Benson, \r\nDanielle Li, and \r\nKelly Shue study employee sales performance and promotion practices at a sample of 214 firms and find evidence that the Peter Principle is real.\r\n\r\nThe researchers find that the cost of promoting high-performing sales representatives regardless of their comparative managerial potential is actually quite high. Their results suggest that firms either are making bad promotion decisions or have embraced the idea that occasional bad promotions are the price they must pay to keep workers motivated.\r\n \r\n", "\nEmployer Concentration and Stagnant Wages \nEfforts to Curb Tax Avoidance Offshore Paid Off, to a Degree\nThe Peter Principle Isn't Just Real, It's Costly \nWhen the Wheat Harvest and the Fracking Boom Rode the Rails\nWorking Longer Can Sharply Raise Retirement Income \n\n< Previous Digest Issues >\n", "  \r\nFirst propounded in the 1969 book The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong, by Laurence J. Peter and Raymond Hull, this principle has been the source of endless fascination, examination, and humor. Among its primary postulates are that promotion decisions often are based on candidates' performance in current roles, not necessarily on the skills needed in their future management roles, and that the best workers are not always the best candidates for certain management positions. \r\n\r\nThe current researchers seek to test these hypotheses in a large-scale study of employee performance and promotion decisions. Importantly, their dataset includes information on performance in managerial roles, which makes it possible to study whether some promotions are ultimately costly to firms. \r\n\r\nUsing data provided by a firm that offers sales performance management software, the researchers obtained access to anonymized records of the companies in the sample and tens of thousands of employees. They observed more than 1,500 employees promoted into management, 156 million sales transactions, and even the work characteristics of those holding jobs, including whether they worked individually or collaboratively. The employees were all in sales in the manufacturing, information technology, and professional-services sectors.\r\n\r\nThe data suggest that high-performing sales representatives are indeed more likely than other workers to be promoted into management. The doubling of sales credits increases the probability that a salesperson will be promoted by 14.3 percent relative to the base probability of promotion. \r\n\r\nThe researchers also found that pre-promotion performance data could negatively predict a new manager's value after promotion: A doubling of the new manager's pre-promotion sales was associated with a 7.5 percent decline in the sales performance of each new manager's subordinates.\r\n\r\nIn another twist, the researchers found that relatively poor prior sales performance among newly promoted managers was associated with significant improvements in their subordinates' performance. This negative correlation is consistent with the view that if firms' promotion policies make it more difficult to be promoted if an employee has poor sales performance, then poor salespeople who are nevertheless promoted should be better managers. \r\n\r\nA key observable trait that can help predict which salespeople might make better managers is whether they have experience working within sales teams, rather than individually. The researchers found that, on average, employees with collaboration experience produce better results as managers.\r\n\r\nThe researchers stress that many firms seem to know that there is a trade-off when promoting top-performing salespeople at the expense of others who might make better managers. The firms accept the cost of weaker management in order to keep a simple and clear incentive structure in place to motivate employees in the sales ranks. \r\n\r\n\"The trade-off between incentives and match quality is likely to be an important consideration for any firm or institution in which the skills required to succeed at one level in the organizational hierarchy differ from the skills necessary to succeed at a higher level,\" the researchers conclude.\r\n\r\n", "\r\nThe Digest is not copyrighted and may be reproduced freely with appropriate attribution of source.

The link time\noptimizations now have a new way of emitting the DWARF debug information,\nwhich makes LTO optimized code more debuggable.  New loop optimizers have\nadded and existing improved and some, like -ftree-loop-distribution,\n-floop-unroll-and-jam and -floop-interchange have been enabled by default at\n-O3.\n\nThe AArch64 target now supports the Scalable Vector Extension, which\nfeatures vectors with runtime determined number of elements.\n\nSome code that compiled successfully with older GCC versions might require\nsource changes, see http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-8/porting_to.html for\ndetails.\n\nSee\n\n  https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-8/changes.html\n\nfor more information about changes in GCC 8.1.\n\nThis release is available from the FTP servers listed here:\n\n http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html\n\nThe release is in gcc/gcc-8.1.0/ subdirectory.\n\nIf you encounter difficulties using GCC 8.1, please do not contact me\ndirectly.  Instead, please visit http://gcc.gnu.org for information about\ngetting help.\n\nDriving a leading free software project such as GNU Compiler Collection\nwould not be possible without support from its many contributors.\nNot to only mention its developers but especially its regular testers\nand users which contribute to its high quality.

And I was searching for threads about\nstartup time because Mercurial's startup time has been getting slower\nover the past few months and this is causing substantial pain.\n\nAs I posted back in 2014 [1], CPython's startup overhead was >10% of the\ntotal CPU time in Mercurial's test suite. And when you factor in the\ntime to import modules that get Mercurial to a point where it can run\ncommands, it was more like 30%!\n\nMercurial's full test suite currently runs `hg` ~25,000 times. Using\nVictor's startup time numbers of 6.4ms for 2.7 and 14.5ms for\n3.7/master, Python startup overhead contributes ~160s on 2.7 and ~360s\non 3.7/master. Even if you divide this by the number of available CPU\ncores, we're talking dozens of seconds of wall time just waiting for\nCPython to get to a place where Mercurial's first bytecode can execute.\n\nAnd the problem is worse when you factor in the time it takes to import\nMercurial's own modules.\n\nAs a concrete example, I recently landed a Mercurial patch [2] that\nstubs out zope.interface to prevent the import of 9 modules on every\n`hg` invocation. This \"only\" saved ~6.94ms for a typical `hg`\ninvocation. But this decreased the CPU time required to run the test\nsuite on my i7-6700K from ~4450s to ~3980s (~89.5% of original) - a\nreduction of almost 8 minutes of CPU time (and over 1 minute of wall time)!\n\nBy the time CPython gets Mercurial to a point where we can run useful\ncode, we've already blown most of or past the time budget where humans\nperceive an action/command as instantaneous. If you ignore startup\noverhead, Mercurial's performance compares quite well to Git's for many\noperations. But the reality is that CPython startup overhead makes it\nlook like Mercurial is non-instantaneous before Mercurial even has the\nopportunity to execute meaningful code!\n\nMercurial provides a `chg` program that essentially spins up a daemon\n`hg` process running a \"command server\" so the `chg` program [written in\nC - no startup overhead] can dispatch commands to an already-running\nPython/`hg` process and avoid paying the startup overhead cost. When you\nrun Mercurial's test suite using `chg`, it completes *minutes* faster.\n`chg` exists mainly as a workaround for slow startup overhead.\n\nChanging gears, my day job is maintaining Firefox's build system. We use\nPython heavily in the build system. And again, Python startup overhead\nis problematic. I don't have numbers offhand, but we invoke likely a few\nhundred Python processes as part of building Firefox. It should be\nseveral thousand. But, we've had to \"hack\" parts of the build system to\n\"batch\" certain build actions in single process invocations in order to\navoid Python startup overhead. This undermines the ability of some build\ntools to formulate a reasonable understanding of the DAG and it causes a\nbit of pain for build system developers and makes it difficult to\nachieve \"no-op\" and fast incremental builds because we're always\ninvoking certain Python processes because we've had to move DAG\nawareness out of the build backend and into Python. At some point, we'll\nlikely replace Python code with Rust so the build system is more \"pure\"\nand easier to maintain and reason about.\n\nI've seen posts in this thread and elsewhere in the CPython development\nuniverse that challenge whether milliseconds in startup time matter.\nSpeaking as a Mercurial and Firefox build system developer,\n*milliseconds absolutely matter*. Going further, *fractions of\nmilliseconds matter*. For Mercurial's test suite with its ~25,000 Python\nprocess invocations, 1ms translates to ~25s of CPU time. With 2.7,\nMercurial can dispatch commands in ~50ms. When you load common\nextensions, it isn't uncommon to see process startup overhead of\n100-150ms! A millisecond here. A millisecond there. Before you know it,\nwe're talking *minutes* of CPU (and potentially wall) time in order to\nrun Mercurial's test suite (or build Firefox, or ...).\n\n>From my perspective, Python process startup and module import overhead\nis a severe problem for Python. I don't say this lightly, but in my mind\nthe problem causes me to question the viability of Python for popular\nuse cases, such as CLI applications. When choosing a programming\nlanguage, I want one that will scale as a project grows. Vanilla process\noverhead has Python starting off significantly slower than compiled code\n(or even Perl) and adding module import overhead into the mix makes\nPython slower and slower as projects grow.

Note that the input and output\n    spaces are matrices with $N$ columns, to account for the fact that generally we are interested\n    in embedding several vectors simultaneously.\n    An example embedding might be a linear embedding, which would be written as\n    \\begin{align*}\n        \\mY = \\mW^\\top \\mX\n    \\end{align*}\n    where $\\mW \\in \\RR^{d \\times k}$.  The figures below show some data in 2 dimensions and\n    sample embeddings in 1 dimensions.\n", "Figure 1:\n        Linear embeddings of ${\\RR^2 \\to \\RR}$, i.e., $d=2$ and $k=1$.\n        \n(left)\n        Clusters of blue, red and\n        orange points are embedded into spaces defined by the\n        solid, dashed and dotted lines through orthogonal projection.\n        \n(right)\n        The associated one dimensional embeddings, with a single tick mark to indicate the\n        embedded value $y=0$.\n        \n(top right) $\\mW=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$\n        (center right) $\\mW=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$\n        (bottom right) $\\mW=\\begin{pmatrix}0.316\\\\0.949\\end{pmatrix}$\n    ", "Figure 2:\n        The Chebyshev nodes (also called\n        the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto points) are an embedding of points\n        (in blue)\n        on a circle onto a diameter\n        (in red)\n        of that circle.  These points are especially useful in\n        approximation theory.\n    ", " In applications such as hashing, it\n    is commonly beneficial to consider random embeddings of vectors.  The distribution of\n    outcomes for randomly chosen embeddings on a set of input data can say something about the\n    structure of the data.(1)\n    Similarly, certain properties might be preseved in the randomly embedded versions of vectors\n    with high probability, such as a sense of\n    distance.\n    The figure below demonstrates that random embeddings can preserve a sense of relative\n    distance with high probability.\n", "Figure 3:\n        Random embeddings can preserve relative distance with high probability.\n        (left) Four vectors in $\\RR^2$.\n        (right) Normalized histograms showing the densities of distances in embedded space\n        between the vectors denoted in the upper right corner of each histogram.  Clearly, there is\n        much greater probability that the embedded versions of red\n        and orange will be closer than of\n        orange and black (roughly 99%).\n    "], "title": "Circulant Binary Embeddings", "by": "Zephyr314", "score": 15, "time": 1525276680, "top_comment": {"kids": [16983094], "parent": 16978229, "text": "Hi, I&#x27;m Scott Clark, one of the founders of SigOpt (YC W15).

Life was the classier of the two, adopting an international scope and employing a heady lineup of photographers, including Henri Cartier-Bresson and W. Eugene Smith. Look, which went out of business in 1971, was more provincial, focusing most of its attention on American pursuits and problems, and hiring photographers who were highly professional but rarely inspired.", "The Look archive resides at the Museum of the City of New York, where an exhibition titled \u201c Through a Different Lens: Stanley Kubrick Photographs,\u201d opens on May 3.

Their photos were illustrating a preconceived story that had been formulated by the editors. The possibilities for discovery were limited.", "The topics that Kubrick explored are chestnuts so old that they smell a little moldy. Lovers embracing on a park bench as their neighbors gaze ostentatiously elsewhere. Patients anxiously awaiting their doctors appointment. Boxing hopefuls in the ring. Celebrities at home. Pampered dogs in the city. It probably helped that Stan Kubrick, as he was known at that time, was just a kid, so instead of inducing yawns, these magazine perennials struck him as novelties, and he in turn brought something fresh to them.", "Knowing what career path he would follow, we look for foreshadowing of his future greatness.

I am sorry for any\ninconvenience this may cause.\n\nPracticalities:\n\nI can unsubscribe myself from the email lists and I disabled email\nnotification on bugzilla and phabricator. Could someone please disable\nmy account on phabricator and delete my svn access? Thanks.\n\nThe long story:\n\nI first became aware of llvm during a compiler course at university. I\nwanted to write a toy scheme frontend to a real compiler. To my shame\nI missed that llvm had a mem2reg pass and selected gcc to avoid having\nto compute ssa form myself.\n\nAfter contributing a few patches to gcc it was clear that the frontend\ninterface needed some cleanup. At the time llvm was being considered\nas a potential new gcc architecture and the idea of a well defined IR\nwith a textual representation was a revolution.\n\nOn my first job (indt) we were using arm cpus and I was able to sell\nthe idea of starting an llvm backend for arm. My first commit was on\nMay 14, 2006. I am incredibly grateful to both indt and the llvm\ndevelopers for trusting and helping such an inexperienced and unknown\ndeveloper with such a large task.\n\nIt is only in May 2007 in the dev meeting that I got to meet the other\ndevelopers in person. It was an incredibly fun event and people were\nas friendly in person as on the list.\n\nIn the next few years I was working at google. First as an sre and\nthen a compiler developer on gcc. During that time I kept llvm as my\n20% project as much as possible. Working on it was always a refreshing\nexperience. It was far easier to change and far less political than gcc\nat the time.\n\nMy opportunity to be back full time on llvm came with portable native\nclient (pnacl). They needed to be able to emit elf objects from llvm ir\nand so I went to work on elf support for mc.\n\nUnfortunately another job change (mozilla) made llvm a side project\nagain after that. I still managed to contribute to llvm/clang as I\nhelped mozilla transition away from gcc 4.2 on OS X.\n\nIt is only about 5 years ago that I started working on llvm full time\nagain. The big item this time was elf support in lld. I was really\nexcited when Rui posted a new design for a coff linker and did my best\nto find a corresponding design for elf.\n\nUnfortunately the last few years haven't been the same. On the\ntechnical side llvm now feels far bigger and slower to change. There\nare many incomplete transitions. That, by itself, would not be\nsufficient reason to leave. llvm still seems better than the\ncompetition and lld itself is still awesome.\n\nThe reason for me leaving are the changes in the community. The\ncurrent license change discussions unfortunately bring to memory the\nfsf politics when I was working on gcc. That would still not be\nsufficient reason to leave. As with the code, llvm will still have the\nbest license and if the only community change was the handling of the\nlicense change I would probably keep going.\n\nThe community change I cannot take is how the social injustice\nmovement has permeated it. When I joined llvm no one asked or cared\nabout my religion or political view. We all seemed committed to just\nwriting a good compiler framework.\n\nSomewhat recently a code of conduct was adopted. It says that the\ncommunity tries to welcome people of all \"political belief\". Except\nthose whose political belief mean that they don't agree with the code\nof conduct. Since agreement is required to take part in the\nconferences, I am no longer able to attend.\n\nThe last drop was llvm associating itself with an organization that\nopenly discriminates based on sex and ancestry (1,2). This goes\ndirectly against my ethical views and I think I must leave the project\nto not be associated with this.\n\nSo long, and thanks for all the bugs,\nRafael\n\n[1] http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2018-February/121161.html\n[2] https://www.outreachy.org/apply/eligibility/\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious message: [llvm-dev] [GSoC 2018] Implement a single updater class for\tDominators\n\nNext message: [llvm-dev] I am leaving llvm\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the llvm-dev\nmailing list\n", "\n\nPrevious message: [llvm-dev] [GSoC 2018] Implement a single updater class for\tDominators\n\nNext message: [llvm-dev] I am leaving llvm\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the llvm-dev\nmailing list\n"], "title": "I am leaving llvm", "by": "cvittal", "score": 185, "time": 1525292711, "top_comment": {"kids": [16981211], "parent": 16980841, "text": "<p><pre><code>  The community change I cannot take is how the social injustice\n  movement has permeated it.

When a buffered\nI/O write fails due to a hardware-level error, filesystems will respond\ndifferently, but that behavior usually includes discarding the data in the\naffected pages and marking them as being clean.

Tom Lane described it as \"kernel brain\ndamage\", while  Robert Haas called it\n\"100% unreasonable\".  In the early part of the discussion, the\nPostgreSQL developers were clear enough on what they thought the kernel's\nbehavior should be: pages that fail to be written out should be kept in\nmemory in the \"dirty\" state (for later retries), and the relevant file\ndescriptor should be put into a permanent error state so that the\nPostgreSQL server cannot miss the existence of a problem.\n\nWhere things go wrong\n\nEven before the kernel community came into the discussion, though, it\nstarted to become clear that the situation was not quite as simple as it\nmight seem.  Thomas Munro reported that\nLinux is not unique in behaving this way; OpenBSD and NetBSD can also fail\nto report write errors to user space.  And, as it turns out, the way that\nPostgreSQL handles buffered I/O complicates the picture considerably.\n\nThat mechanism was described in detail by\nHaas.  The PostgreSQL server runs as a collection of processes, many of\nwhich can perform I/O to the database files.  The job of calling\nfsync(), however, is handled in a single \"checkpointer\" process,\nwhich is concerned with keeping on-disk storage in a consistent state that\ncan recover from failures.  The checkpointer doesn't normally keep all of\nthe relevant files open, so it often has to open a file before calling\nfsync() on it.  That is where the problem comes in: even in 4.13\nand later kernels, the checkpointer will not see any errors that happened\nbefore it opened the file.  If something bad happens before the\ncheckpointer's open() call, the\nsubsequent fsync() call will return successfully.  There are a\nnumber of ways in which an I/O error can happen outside of an\nfsync() call; the kernel could encounter one while performing\nbackground writeback, for example.  Somebody calling sync() could\nalso encounter an I/O error \u2014 and consume the resulting error status.\n\nHaas described this behavior as failing to live up to what PostgreSQL\nexpects: \n\n\n\tWhat you have (or someone has) basically done here is made an\n\tundocumented assumption about which file descriptors might care\n\tabout a particular error, but it just so happens that PostgreSQL\n\thas never conformed to that assumption.

Dave Chinner quickly described this behavior as \"a recipe for\ndisaster, especially on cross-platform code where every OS platform behaves\ndifferently and almost never to expectation\".  Ted Ts'o, instead, explained why the affected pages are marked\nclean after an I/O error occurs; in short, the most common cause of I/O\nerrors, by far, is a user pulling out a USB drive at the wrong time.  If\nsome process was copying a lot of data to that drive, the result will be an\naccumulation of dirty pages in memory, perhaps to the point that the system\nas a whole runs out of memory for anything else.  So those pages cannot be\nkept if the user wants the system to remain usable after such an event.\n\nBoth Chinner and Ts'o, along with others, said that the proper solution is\nfor PostgreSQL to move to direct I/O (DIO) instead.  Using DIO gives a\ngreater level of control over writeback and I/O in general; that includes\naccess to information on exactly which I/O operations might have failed.\nAndres Freund, like a number of other PostgreSQL developers, has acknowledged that DIO is the best long-term\nsolution.  But he also noted that getting there is \"a metric ton of\nwork\" that isn't going to happen anytime soon.  Meanwhile, he said, there are other programs (he mentioned\ndpkg) that are also affected by this behavior.\n\nToward a short-term solution\n\nAs the discussion went on, a fair amount of attention was paid to the\nidea that write failures should result in the affected pages being kept in\nmemory, in their dirty state.

So this change seems unlikely to happen.\n\nAt one point in the discussion, Ts'o mentioned that Google has its own mechanism\nfor handling I/O errors.

A call to syncfs() would then clear that flag and return\nan error if it had been set.  The PostgreSQL checkpointer could make an\noccasional syncfs() call as a way of polling for errors on the\nfilesystem holding the database.

Some\npatches merged during the 4.13 development cycle improved the situation\nsomewhat (and 4.16 had some changes to improve it further), but there are\nstill ways for error notifications to be lost, as\nwill be described below.  If\nthat happens to a PostgreSQL server, the result can be silent corruption of\nthe database.\n\nPostgreSQL developers were not pleased.  Tom Lane described it as \"kernel brain\ndamage\", while  Robert Haas called it\n\"100% unreasonable\".  In the early part of the discussion, the\nPostgreSQL developers were clear enough on what they thought the kernel's\nbehavior should be: pages that fail to be written out should be kept in\nmemory in the \"dirty\" state (for later retries), and the relevant file\ndescriptor should be put into a permanent error state so that the\nPostgreSQL server cannot miss the existence of a problem.\n\nWhere things go wrong\n\nEven before the kernel community came into the discussion, though, it\nstarted to become clear that the situation was not quite as simple as it\nmight seem.  Thomas Munro reported that\nLinux is not unique in behaving this way; OpenBSD and NetBSD can also fail\nto report write errors to user space.  And, as it turns out, the way that\nPostgreSQL handles buffered I/O complicates the picture considerably.\n\nThat mechanism was described in detail by\nHaas.  The PostgreSQL server runs as a collection of processes, many of\nwhich can perform I/O to the database files.  The job of calling\nfsync(), however, is handled in a single \"checkpointer\" process,\nwhich is concerned with keeping on-disk storage in a consistent state that\ncan recover from failures.  The checkpointer doesn't normally keep all of\nthe relevant files open, so it often has to open a file before calling\nfsync() on it.  That is where the problem comes in: even in 4.13\nand later kernels, the checkpointer will not see any errors that happened\nbefore it opened the file.  If something bad happens before the\ncheckpointer's open() call, the\nsubsequent fsync() call will return successfully.  There are a\nnumber of ways in which an I/O error can happen outside of an\nfsync() call; the kernel could encounter one while performing\nbackground writeback, for example.  Somebody calling sync() could\nalso encounter an I/O error \u2014 and consume the resulting error status.\n\nHaas described this behavior as failing to live up to what PostgreSQL\nexpects: \n\n\n\tWhat you have (or someone has) basically done here is made an\n\tundocumented assumption about which file descriptors might care\n\tabout a particular error, but it just so happens that PostgreSQL\n\thas never conformed to that assumption.  You can keep on saying the\n\tproblem is with our assumptions, but it doesn't seem like a very\n\tgood guess to me to suppose that we're the only program that has\n\tever made them.\n\n\nJoshua Drake eventually moved the\nconversation over to the ext4 development list, bringing in part of the\nkernel development community.  Dave Chinner quickly described this behavior as \"a recipe for\ndisaster, especially on cross-platform code where every OS platform behaves\ndifferently and almost never to expectation\".  Ted Ts'o, instead, explained why the affected pages are marked\nclean after an I/O error occurs; in short, the most common cause of I/O\nerrors, by far, is a user pulling out a USB drive at the wrong time.  If\nsome process was copying a lot of data to that drive, the result will be an\naccumulation of dirty pages in memory, perhaps to the point that the system\nas a whole runs out of memory for anything else.  So those pages cannot be\nkept if the user wants the system to remain usable after such an event.\n\nBoth Chinner and Ts'o, along with others, said that the proper solution is\nfor PostgreSQL to move to direct I/O (DIO) instead.  Using DIO gives a\ngreater level of control over writeback and I/O in general; that includes\naccess to information on exactly which I/O operations might have failed.\nAndres Freund, like a number of other PostgreSQL developers, has acknowledged that DIO is the best long-term\nsolution.  But he also noted that getting there is \"a metric ton of\nwork\" that isn't going to happen anytime soon.  Meanwhile, he said, there are other programs (he mentioned\ndpkg) that are also affected by this behavior.\n\nToward a short-term solution\n\nAs the discussion went on, a fair amount of attention was paid to the\nidea that write failures should result in the affected pages being kept in\nmemory, in their dirty state.  But the PostgreSQL developers had quickly\nmoved on from\nthat idea and were not asking for it.  What they really need, in the end,\nis a reliable way to know that something has gone wrong.  Given that, the\nnormal PostgreSQL mechanisms for dealing with errors can take over; in its\nabsence, though, there is little that can be done.\n\nOne idea that came up a few times was to respond to an I/O error by marking\nthe file itself (in the inode) as being in a persistent error state.  Such\na change, though, would take Linux behavior further away from what POSIX\nmandates and would raise some other questions, including: when and how\nwould that flag ever be cleared?  So this change seems unlikely to happen.\n\nAt one point in the discussion, Ts'o mentioned that Google has its own mechanism\nfor handling I/O errors.  The\nkernel has been instrumented to report I/O errors via a netlink socket; a\ndedicated process gets those notifications and responds accordingly.  This\nmechanism has never made it upstream, though.  Freund indicated that this kind of mechanism would be\n\"perfect\" for PostgreSQL, so it may make a public appearance\nin the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeff Layton pondered another\nidea: setting a flag in the filesystem superblock when an I/O error\noccurs.  A call to syncfs() would then clear that flag and return\nan error if it had been set.  The PostgreSQL checkpointer could make an\noccasional syncfs() call as a way of polling for errors on the\nfilesystem holding the database.  Freund agreed that this might be a viable solution to\nthe problem.\n\nAny such mechanism will only appear in new kernels, of course; meanwhile,\nPostgreSQL installations tend to run on old kernels maintained by\nenterprise distributions.  Those kernels are likely to lack even the\nimprovements merged in 4.13.  For such systems, there is little that can be\ndone to help PostgreSQL detect I/O errors.  It may come down to running a\ndaemon that scans the system log, looking for reports of I/O errors there.\nNot the most elegant solution, and one that is complicated by the fact that\ndifferent block drivers and filesystems tend to report errors differently,\nbut it may be the best option available.\n\nThe next step is likely to be a discussion at the 2018 LSFMM event, which\nhappens to start on April\u00a023.  With luck, some sort of solution will\nemerge that will work for the parties involved.

I am sorry for any\ninconvenience this may cause.\n\nPracticalities:\n\nI can unsubscribe myself from the email lists and I disabled email\nnotification on bugzilla and phabricator. Could someone please disable\nmy account on phabricator and delete my svn access? Thanks.\n\nThe long story:\n\nI first became aware of llvm during a compiler course at university. I\nwanted to write a toy scheme frontend to a real compiler. To my shame\nI missed that llvm had a mem2reg pass and selected gcc to avoid having\nto compute ssa form myself.\n\nAfter contributing a few patches to gcc it was clear that the frontend\ninterface needed some cleanup. At the time llvm was being considered\nas a potential new gcc architecture and the idea of a well defined IR\nwith a textual representation was a revolution.\n\nOn my first job (indt) we were using arm cpus and I was able to sell\nthe idea of starting an llvm backend for arm. My first commit was on\nMay 14, 2006. I am incredibly grateful to both indt and the llvm\ndevelopers for trusting and helping such an inexperienced and unknown\ndeveloper with such a large task.\n\nIt is only in May 2007 in the dev meeting that I got to meet the other\ndevelopers in person. It was an incredibly fun event and people were\nas friendly in person as on the list.\n\nIn the next few years I was working at google. First as an sre and\nthen a compiler developer on gcc. During that time I kept llvm as my\n20% project as much as possible. Working on it was always a refreshing\nexperience. It was far easier to change and far less political than gcc\nat the time.\n\nMy opportunity to be back full time on llvm came with portable native\nclient (pnacl). They needed to be able to emit elf objects from llvm ir\nand so I went to work on elf support for mc.\n\nUnfortunately another job change (mozilla) made llvm a side project\nagain after that. I still managed to contribute to llvm/clang as I\nhelped mozilla transition away from gcc 4.2 on OS X.\n\nIt is only about 5 years ago that I started working on llvm full time\nagain. The big item this time was elf support in lld. I was really\nexcited when Rui posted a new design for a coff linker and did my best\nto find a corresponding design for elf.\n\nUnfortunately the last few years haven't been the same. On the\ntechnical side llvm now feels far bigger and slower to change. There\nare many incomplete transitions. That, by itself, would not be\nsufficient reason to leave. llvm still seems better than the\ncompetition and lld itself is still awesome.\n\nThe reason for me leaving are the changes in the community. The\ncurrent license change discussions unfortunately bring to memory the\nfsf politics when I was working on gcc. That would still not be\nsufficient reason to leave. As with the code, llvm will still have the\nbest license and if the only community change was the handling of the\nlicense change I would probably keep going.\n\nThe community change I cannot take is how the social injustice\nmovement has permeated it. When I joined llvm no one asked or cared\nabout my religion or political view. We all seemed committed to just\nwriting a good compiler framework.\n\nSomewhat recently a code of conduct was adopted. It says that the\ncommunity tries to welcome people of all \"political belief\". Except\nthose whose political belief mean that they don't agree with the code\nof conduct. Since agreement is required to take part in the\nconferences, I am no longer able to attend.\n\nThe last drop was llvm associating itself with an organization that\nopenly discriminates based on sex and ancestry (1,2). This goes\ndirectly against my ethical views and I think I must leave the project\nto not be associated with this.\n\nSo long, and thanks for all the bugs,\nRafael\n\n[1] http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2018-February/121161.html\n[2] https://www.outreachy.org/apply/eligibility/\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious message: [llvm-dev] [GSoC 2018] Implement a single updater class for\tDominators\n\nNext message: [llvm-dev] I am leaving llvm\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the llvm-dev\nmailing list\n", "\n\nPrevious message: [llvm-dev] [GSoC 2018] Implement a single updater class for\tDominators\n\nNext message: [llvm-dev] I am leaving llvm\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the llvm-dev\nmailing list\n"], "title": "LLVM Developer Leaves Citing Code of Conduct", "by": "crashride", "score": 13, "time": 1525297474, "top_comment": {"kids": [16981986, 16981959], "parent": 16981420, "text": "Seriously?

The text below is his.\n\n\n\nA fundamental issue with CLEAR approach is that it effectively tells\nlaw enforcement officers to trust phones handed to them by criminals,\nand give such phones whatever unlock keys they request. This provides\na powerful avenue of attack for an adversary who uses phones as a\nTrojan horse.\n\nFor example, the following \"man-in-the-middle\" attack can let a\ncriminal unlock a victim's phone that reached their possession, if\nthat phone is CLEAR-compliant. The criminal would turn on the victim\nphone, perform the requisite gesture to display the \"device unlock\nrequest\" QR code, and copy this code. They would then program a new\n\"relay\" phone to impersonate the victim phone: when the relay phone\nis turned on, it shows the victim's QR code instead of its own.\n(This behavior is not CLEAR-compliant, but that's not much of a barrier:\nthe criminal can just buy a non-compliant phone or cobble one from\nreadily-available components). The criminal would plant the relay\nphone in some place where law enforcement is likely to take keen\ninteret in it, such as a staged crime scene or near a foreign\nembassy. Law enforcement would diligently collect the phone and,\nunder the CLEAR procedure, turn it on to retrieve the \"device unlock\nrequest\" QR code (which, unbeknownst to them, is actually the\nvictim's code). Law enforcement would then obtain a corresponding\nsearch warrant, retrieve the unlock code from the vendor, and\nhelpfully present it to the relay phone \u2014 which will promptly relay\nthe code to the criminal, who can then enter the same code into the\nvictim's phone. The victim's code, upon receiving this code, will\nspill all its secrets to the criminal. The relay phone can even\npresent law enforcement with a fake view of its own contents, so\nthat no anomaly is apparent.\n\nThe good news is that this attack requires the criminal to go through\nthe motions anew for for every victim phone, so it cannot easily\nunlock phones en masse. Still, this would provide little consolation\nto, say, a victim whose company secrets or cryptocurrency assets\nhave been stolen by a targeted attack.\n\nIt it plausible that such man-in-the-middle attacks can be mitigated\nby modern cryptographic authentication protocols coupled with\nphysical measures such as tamper-resistant hardware or communication\nlatency measurements. But this is a difficult challenge that requires\ncareful design and review, and would introduce extra assumptions,\ncosts and fragility into the system.\nBlocking communication (e.g.,\nusing Faraday cages) is also a possible measure, though notoriously\ndifficult, unwieldy and expensive.\n\nAnother problem is that CLEAR phones must resist \"jailbreaking\",\ni.e., must not let phone owners modify the operating system or\nfirmware on their own phones. This is because CLEAR critically\nrelies on users not being able to tamper with their phones' unlocking\nfunctionality, and this functionality would surely be implemented\nin software, as part of the operating system or firmware, due to\nits sheer complexity (e.g., it includes the \"device unlock request\"\nscreen, QR code recognition, crytographic verification of unlock\ncodes, and transmission of data dumps). In practice, it is well-nigh\nimpossible to prevent jailbreaking in complex consumer devices, and\neven for state-of-the-art locked-down platforms such as Apple's\niOS, jailbreak methods are typically discovered and widely circulated\nsoon after every operating system update. Note that jailbreaking\nalso exacerbates the aforementioned man-in-the-middle attack: to\ncreate the relay phone, the criminal may pick any burner phone from\na nearby store, and even if such phones are CLEAR-compliant by\ndecree, jailbreaking them would allow them to be reprogrammed as a\nrelay.\n\nAdditional risks stem from having an attacker-controlled electronics\noperating within law enforcement premises. A phone can eavesdrop\non investigators's conversations, or even steal private cryptographic\nkeys from investigator's computers. For examples of the how the\nlatter may be done using a plain smartphone or hardware hidden that\ncan fit in a customized phone, see\nhttp://cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic,\nhttp://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/radioexp,\nand\nhttp://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/mobilesc.\nWhile prudent forensics\nprocedures can mitigate this risk, these too would introduce new\ncosts and complexity.\n\nThese are powerful avenues of attack, because phones are flexible\ndevices with the capability to display arbitrary information,\ncommunicate wirelessly with adversaries, and spy on their environment.\nIn a critical forensic investigation, you would never want to turn\non a phone and run whatever nefarious or self-destructing software\nmay be programmed in it. Moreover, the last thing you'd do is let\na phone found on the street issue requests to a highly sensitive\nsystem that dispenses unlock codes (even if these requests are\nissued indirectly, through a well-meaning but hapless law enforcement\nofficer who's just following procedure).\n\nIndeed, in computer forensics, a basic precaution against such\nattacks is to never turn on the computer in an uncontrolled fashion;\nrather, you would extract its storage data and analyze it on a\ndifferent, trustworthy computer. But the CLEAR scheme relies on\nkeeping the phone intact, and even turning it on and trusting it\nto communicate as intended during the recovery procedure. Telling\nthe guards of Troy to bring any suspicious wooden horse into the\ncity walls, and to grant it an audience with the king, may not be\nthe best policy solution to \"Going Greek\" debate.\n\n", "\nEran has kindly given me his description of it, with permission to\npublish it on my blog.

The criminal would turn on the victim\nphone, perform the requisite gesture to display the \"device unlock\nrequest\" QR code, and copy this code. They would then program a new\n\"relay\" phone to impersonate the victim phone: when the relay phone\nis turned on, it shows the victim's QR code instead of its own.\n(This behavior is not CLEAR-compliant, but that's not much of a barrier:\nthe criminal can just buy a non-compliant phone or cobble one from\nreadily-available components). The criminal would plant the relay\nphone in some place where law enforcement is likely to take keen\ninteret in it, such as a staged crime scene or near a foreign\nembassy. Law enforcement would diligently collect the phone and,\nunder the CLEAR procedure, turn it on to retrieve the \"device unlock\nrequest\" QR code (which, unbeknownst to them, is actually the\nvictim's code). Law enforcement would then obtain a corresponding\nsearch warrant, retrieve the unlock code from the vendor, and\nhelpfully present it to the relay phone \u2014 which will promptly relay\nthe code to the criminal, who can then enter the same code into the\nvictim's phone. The victim's code, upon receiving this code, will\nspill all its secrets to the criminal. The relay phone can even\npresent law enforcement with a fake view of its own contents, so\nthat no anomaly is apparent.\n\nThe good news is that this attack requires the criminal to go through\nthe motions anew for for every victim phone, so it cannot easily\nunlock phones en masse. Still, this would provide little consolation\nto, say, a victim whose company secrets or cryptocurrency assets\nhave been stolen by a targeted attack.\n\nIt it plausible that such man-in-the-middle attacks can be mitigated\nby modern cryptographic authentication protocols coupled with\nphysical measures such as tamper-resistant hardware or communication\nlatency measurements. But this is a difficult challenge that requires\ncareful design and review, and would introduce extra assumptions,\ncosts and fragility into the system.\nBlocking communication (e.g.,\nusing Faraday cages) is also a possible measure, though notoriously\ndifficult, unwieldy and expensive.\n\nAnother problem is that CLEAR phones must resist \"jailbreaking\",\ni.e., must not let phone owners modify the operating system or\nfirmware on their own phones. This is because CLEAR critically\nrelies on users not being able to tamper with their phones' unlocking\nfunctionality, and this functionality would surely be implemented\nin software, as part of the operating system or firmware, due to\nits sheer complexity (e.g., it includes the \"device unlock request\"\nscreen, QR code recognition, crytographic verification of unlock\ncodes, and transmission of data dumps). In practice, it is well-nigh\nimpossible to prevent jailbreaking in complex consumer devices, and\neven for state-of-the-art locked-down platforms such as Apple's\niOS, jailbreak methods are typically discovered and widely circulated\nsoon after every operating system update. Note that jailbreaking\nalso exacerbates the aforementioned man-in-the-middle attack: to\ncreate the relay phone, the criminal may pick any burner phone from\na nearby store, and even if such phones are CLEAR-compliant by\ndecree, jailbreaking them would allow them to be reprogrammed as a\nrelay.\n\nAdditional risks stem from having an attacker-controlled electronics\noperating within law enforcement premises. A phone can eavesdrop\non investigators's conversations, or even steal private cryptographic\nkeys from investigator's computers. For examples of the how the\nlatter may be done using a plain smartphone or hardware hidden that\ncan fit in a customized phone, see\nhttp://cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic,\nhttp://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/radioexp,\nand\nhttp://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/mobilesc.\nWhile prudent forensics\nprocedures can mitigate this risk, these too would introduce new\ncosts and complexity.\n\nThese are powerful avenues of attack, because phones are flexible\ndevices with the capability to display arbitrary information,\ncommunicate wirelessly with adversaries, and spy on their environment.\nIn a critical forensic investigation, you would never want to turn\non a phone and run whatever nefarious or self-destructing software\nmay be programmed in it. Moreover, the last thing you'd do is let\na phone found on the street issue requests to a highly sensitive\nsystem that dispenses unlock codes (even if these requests are\nissued indirectly, through a well-meaning but hapless law enforcement\nofficer who's just following procedure).\n\nIndeed, in computer forensics, a basic precaution against such\nattacks is to never turn on the computer in an uncontrolled fashion;\nrather, you would extract its storage data and analyze it on a\ndifferent, trustworthy computer.

It also demonstrated that Kilopower's passive operations -- once it gets going, human input isn't needed to keep it running or to regulate it -- are reliable.

I hear the \u201cshouts in the street\u201d of Irish schoolboys\u2014what Stephen Dedalus calls \u201cGod\u201d in James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses\u2014as clearly as I do the susurrations of my dog Bloom beneath my desk as I write. I picture the cemetery where my dog\u2019s namesake, Leopold Bloom, attends the funeral of Paddy Dignam, spying at the edges of the funeral party a \u201clankylooking galoot\u201d wearing a mackintosh, more vividly than I can any of the cemeteries in which my grandparents are buried. I have an uncanny familiarity with what Dedalus elsewhere calls the \u201citems in the catalogue of Dublin\u2019s furniture\u201d: the Martello Tower at Sandycove, the Forty Foot promontory, the \u201cscrotumtightening sea\u201d below, the \u201cunwholesome sandflats\u201d of Sandymount Strand, the residence at 7 Eccles Street, Sweny\u2019s Chemist, Trinity College, Merchant\u2019s Arch, where a man might buy a smutty book like Sweets of Sin for his wife, and on through to the Liffey.\nThis March marked the hundredth anniversary of the publication of the first chapter of Ulysses\u2014the preeminent \u201cmodernist city novel\u201d\u2014in The Little Review. Joyce said to writer Frank Budgen, as they walked along the Universit\u00e4tstrasse in Zurich, that one of his goals in writing Ulysses was \u201cto give a picture of Dublin so complete that if the city one day suddenly disappeared from the earth it could be reconstructed out of my book.\u201d One can imagine John Dos Passos stating a similar aim with regards to his New York City novel Manhattan Transfer, or Alfred D\u00f6blin saying the same of his Berlin Alexanderplatz. These three novels are modernist city novels of the interwar period that move beyond story and character to build structures and trace movements, reconstructing modern metropolises that a world war would soon change forever. Joyce, Dos Passos, and D\u00f6blin fashioned not novels but eternal text-cities in which the reader may witness, wander, get lost.\n\nOstensibly, Berlin Alexanderplatz\u2014reissued last month by NYRB Classics in a new, long-awaited Michael Hofmann translation\u2014is the tale of Franz Biberkopf, \u201cformer transport worker, housebreaker, pimp, manslaughterer,\u201d who, upon his release from Tegel Penitentiary, attempts to stay on the straight and narrow. But Berlin is\u2014perhaps as all cities are\u2014a maze of curves and angles, making any straight and narrow path potentially untenable. In titling the book Berlin Alexanderplatz, though, D\u00f6blin tips his hand: the traditional concerns of the bourgeois novel\u2014specifically, character and plot\u2014are replaced by an unprecedented interest in the setting, in that urban space, Berlin. The novel is as concerned with presenting the streams of the city\u2019s consciousness as it is with the internal monologues of its protagonist. The reader drifts from page to page as if from street to street. There is a plot, but it is not the principal force of the novel. When D\u00f6blin follows a particular plot point too closely, he admits as much: \u201cIf the reader is not interested in pursuing that, he can simply skip the following few pages.\u201d It is easier to imagine the novel sans Biberkopf than it is to imagine it outside of Berlin.\nNo wonder, then, that Biberkopf is elsewhere described as a \u201ccement worker, later furniture mover.\u201d Cities are cement and furniture, building and bustle, things that stay still and things that move. Of course, things that stay still in a city can suddenly, and will eventually, move, grow, change, decay, disappear. Buildings crumble, stores go out of business, streets age, accumulating faultlines like faces. Things that move can and do also momentarily pause. A busker stares up at a pedestrian silhouetted by the sun, still as a statue, his last note lingering. The maelstrom of traffic often screeches to a halt. This is why cities are so difficult to capture in a traditional realist novel, and why they\u2019re the perfect grist for modernist experimentation: the city resists being seen as pure architecture or pure activity. We mistake the city if we take it for mere setting or plot. The city is character; it breathes its own life, speaks in its own tongue, moves to its own rhythms.\n\n\u00a0\nAs Biberkopf first enters Berlin, the city\u2019s cacophony overwhelms him\u2014and a barrage of impressions rush toward the reader:\nThe streets were full of bustle, Seestrasse, people got on and off. Something in him screamed: Watch out, watch out. The tip of his nose felt cold, something brushed his cheek. Zw\u00f6lf Uhr Mittagszeitung, B.Z, Die neuste Illustrierte, Die Funkstunde. Any more fares. The police have blue uniforms now. He made his way off the tram unnoticed, mingled with the crowd. What was wrong? Nothing. Hey, watch where you\u2019re going or I\u2019ll whop you. The crowds, the crowds. My skull needs grease, it must have dried out. All that stuff. Shoe shops, hat shops, electric lights, bars. People will need shoes to run around in, we had a shoe shop too, once, let\u2019s not forget that. Hundreds of shiny windows, let them flash away at you, they\u2019re nothing to be afraid of, it\u2019s just that they\u2019ve been cleaned, you can always smash them if you want.\n\nA year after the release of Berlin Alexanderplatz, Walter Benjamin claimed, \u201cThe stylistic principle governing this book is that of montage. Petty-bourgeois printed matter, scandalmongering, stories of accidents, the sensational incidents of 1928, folk songs, and advertisements rain down in this text.\u201d D\u00f6blin not only gives us exquisite descriptions of the architecture and inhabitants of the city, but tosses in weather reports (\u201cAn area of low pressure is moving slowly south over a broad front\u201d) and scientific formulas (\u201cThe size of the force is expressed with the following formula\u201d), retellings of ancient myth (\u201cAgamemnon, his father, had set out\u201d) and casualty statistics (\u201cIn Berlin in 1927, there were 48,742 deaths\u201d), among a maze of other material ordinarily absent from the novel. The narrative apparatus of this text (and of its modernist city-novel brethren) is a bricolage labyrinth\u2014and not only does this replicate the city\u2019s muddle, it also leads the novel down unexplored corridors. \u201cThe montage explodes the framework of the novel,\u201d Benjamin writes, \u201cbursts its limits both stylistically and structurally, and clears the way for new, epic possibilities.\u201d\n\nThe city, as best expressed in modernist literature, reveals its own \u201cinexhaustible richness\u201d (to borrow a phrase Virginia Woolf used to describe London) through formal innovation and stylistic play. We see this not only in D\u00f6blin\u2019s Berlin, Joyce\u2019s Dublin, and Dos Passos\u2019 New York City, but in Woolf\u2019s London, Marcel Proust\u2019s Paris, Franz Kafka\u2019s Prague, Robert Musil\u2019s Vienna, Andrei Bely\u2019s St. Petersburg, and the Harlem of the Harlem Renaissance poets. These writers were not party to the same exact project, but each used avant garde stylistic and formal approaches to represent the muddled metropolis.\nThis conception of the metropolis, though, wasn\u2019t entirely a modernist creation. The city had long been seen as a site of chaos and confusion, action and grime, mystery and danger. Cesare Pavese claimed that, years before the experiments of Joyce and D\u00f6blin, \u201cBalzac discovered the big city as a den of mysteries, and the sense he keeps ever-alert is that of curiosity.\u201d According to Italo Calvino:\nTo make a novel out of a city, to represent the streets and the various districts as dramatis personae, each one with a character in conflict with every other; to give life to human figures and situations as if they were spontaneous growths from the cobbles of the streets, or else protagonists in such dramatic contrast with them as to cause a whole string of disasters; to work in such a way that at every changing moment the true protagonist was the living city, its biological continuity, the monster that was Paris\u2014this is what Balzac felt impelled to do when he began to write Ferragus.\n\nWhile it is true that Balzac\u2019s Paris is a multifarious monster\u2014precursor to the textual Berlins and Dublins that came after\u2014the difference between Balzac and his city-novel progeny is that the modernists were less concerned with a city\u2019s \u201cbiological continuity\u201d (its unity, progression, and connective tissue) and more interested in what could be called a city\u2019s \u201cbiological discontinuity\u201d (its intrinsic inability to adhere to a tidy narrative). This is what D\u00f6blin meant when he referred to \u201cthe chaos of cities.\u201d In exploration of this biological discontinuity and in articulation of a certain urban texture, the modernists implemented new ways to embody the city\u2019s multitude: the stream of consciousness, multiple perspectives, free indirect discourse, appropriation, fragmentation, and, especially, montage.\n\u00a0\nThough the play with innovative forms, modes, and registers is one of the defining qualities of modernism, not all modernists used the same devices to reach identical ends. While Virginia Woolf did \u201cdramatize London perpetually,\u201d as she explained in the last year of her life, she never attempted to fully reconstruct the city in a novel in the way Joyce attempted to reconstruct Dublin in Ulysses. She was drawn toward describing the metropolis, giving it gorgeous expression through the impressions and sensations of her characters. Her sentences unspool like film stock, projecting one image unto the next, but they are representational, and filter through her characters\u2019 consciousnesses like point-of-view shots in a movie.\nIn the work of Joyce, D\u00f6blin, and Dos Passos, similar stylistic techniques were performed not merely to describe the city but to reconstruct it. The focus on reconstructing the city and its consciousness (and the expression of this consciousness through extensive use of tools like montage and free indirect discourse) doesn\u2019t just allow these texts to map out an urban landscape, but to become Baedekers in brick and mortar. In other words, Ulysses is not an atlas of Dublin, it is a Dublin; Berlin Alexanderplatz, likewise, is a Berlin. These are not novels; they are cities unto themselves, writ in text of stone and concrete.\n\nJoyce Carol Oates once asked, \u201cIf the city is a text, how shall we read it?\u201d With these novels, the question must be reversed: \u201cIf the text is a city, how shall we walk through it?\u201d The answer lies in seeing the reader of the text as that infamous reader of the city: the fl\u00e2neur, using what Walter Benjamin called \u201cthe ambulatory gaze that the fl\u00e2neur directs on [the city].\u201d For the reader-fl\u00e2neur, linearity isn\u2019t important; it\u2019s about wandering through the text and seeing what one sees, letting the city speak. In Manhattan Transfer, for example, the New York City docks communicate their cacophony as we readers wander by:\nStreak of water crusted with splinters, groceryboxes, orangepeel, cabbageleaves, narrowing, narrowing between the boat and the dock. A brass band shining in the sun, white caps, sweaty red faces, playing Yankee Doodle. \u201cThat\u2019s for the ambassador, you know the tall man who never left his cabin.\u201d Down the slanting gangplank, careful not to trip. Yankee Doodle went to town\u2026Shiny black face, white enameled eyes, white enameled teeth. \u201cYas ma\u2019am, yas ma\u2019am\u201d\u2026Stucka feather in his hat, an called it macaroni\u2026\u201cWe have the freedom of the port.\u201d Blue custom officer shows a bald head bowing low\u2026Tumte boomboom BOOM BOOM BOOM\u2026cakes and sugar candy.\n\nIn text-cities like Ulysses, Berlin Alexanderplatz, and Manhattan Transfer, readers walk through words and pages, experiencing a city alive, asserting its idiosyncrasy, its uniqueness\u2014fleeting, eternal, fugitive, infinite\u2014amid the ebb and flow of passages. So I have indeed been to Dublin\u2014a Dublin, at least\u2014and a Berlin, too, walked through them, explored them, felt their rhythms, regardless of whether or not I\u2019ve actually stepped foot on Irish or German soil.\n\u00a0\nRead more on text-cities in our Fall 2010 issue,\u00a0The City.\n", "Sometimes I forget that I\u2019ve never been to Dublin.

As standards mature and 'off the shelf' implementations become more common, we're publishing some of our software as open source contributions to further aid adoption.", "BBC R&D - Beyond Streams and Files - Storing Frames in the Cloud", "One aspect of our work has covered the challenges of using software to transmit and receive streams of high data rate media over IP networks. This is all the more relevant as the broadcast industry starts to deploy facilities\u00a0which implement the SMPTE 2110 suite of standards. The unique challenge here involves handling IP packets (around 1500 bytes each) at data rates of between 1 and 8 Gigabits per second for typical uncompressed High Definition and Ultra High Definition formats. As we discovered, one of the greatest bottlenecks when handling this volume of data in software is the computational expense of copying these packets between different areas of memory, something which has to happen multiple times when using the Linux kernel's standard sockets library. Back in 2015 we discussed our use of the open source project Netmap on 25 and 100Gb/s IP networks, which is one of several possible tools which allow the transmission and reception of much higher data rates by using 'kernel bypass' techniques.\u00a0As the name suggests, this mechanism bypasses the operating system's default path for processing packets, providing a more direct route between applications and the network hardware.", "Whilst Netmap helps us to reduce the number of copy operations required, we can further enhance performance by interacting directly with the network interface card (NIC) hardware, allowing multiple packets to be passed to the NIC at one time. This could be achieved by interacting directly with any vendor's NIC driver from our applications, but given a desire to prototype with a range of network cards we didn't want to have to write code to interact with each vendor's driver directly.

A stab at \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude\u201d is not so lucky: \u201c\u00a0\u2018Forget the contents!\u2019 said the editor. \u2018No one could possibly follow that story.

Finished in 1895, the brilliant \u201cLate Fame\u201d concerns an aging Viennese civil servant who, virtually out of nowhere, is crowned a master poet by an eccentric coffeehouse group of striving writers and actors. The tale consists of little more than the man\u2019s ascension and the orchestration of a public reading, yet in Schnitzler\u2019s hands it becomes a distorted mirror onto the less-talked-about side of literary life\u2014from workshopping to self-promotion, favor trading, and reviews. (\u201cWas it even allowed,\u201d the complacent and cipher-ish hero, Eduard Saxberger, reflects apropos of reviews, \u201cto take a decent person who had done nothing wrong and treat him like this?\u201d) Inwardly, Saxberger goes from feeling that life has passed him by to feeling awakened to his inborn specialness, that \u201che was indeed a poet!\u201d The slim book that he bases this realization on, \u201cThe Wanderings,\u201d was written more than thirty years ago, but never mind: it\u2019s a good fit for the cultish and bickering Enthusiasm Society, whose members decry literary fashion and careerism while rallying around a conviction in their own criminally ignored gifts.", "For Schnitzler himself, of course, recognition was not in doubt, with success arriving in his thirties and four volumes of collected writings to his name by the time he was fifty. In the States, his output has often been synonymous with just a couple of works (both of them daringly erotic for their time) and especially with their film adaptations: \u201cReigen\u201d was adapted into \u201cLa Ronde\u201d by Max Oph\u00fcls, in 1950, and again by Roger Vadim, featuring Jane Fonda, in 1964; a bit more recently, \u201cTraumnovelle\u201d inspired Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cEyes Wide Shut.\u201d But Schnitzler, a doctor before retiring to write, was prolific, in prose as well as drama. \u201cLate Fame\u201d was unreleased in his lifetime; it was meant for the periodical Die Zeit, but ultimately rejected on the grounds of length. Where most of Schnitzler\u2019s reprinted novels in English are notable for their advanced psychological realism (Freud saw him as something of a doppelg\u00e4nger), \u201cLate Fame\u201d is wholeheartedly comic, albeit with a touch of pathos and its own kind of unmasking. The story\u2019s conceit packs a sting for creatives. After all, where is the writer who has never felt like an impostor?", "The restless souls at the center of Schnitzler\u2019s farce, mischievously and briskly delineated, were partly modelled on the group of writers known as \u201cYoung Vienna\u201d: critics bring up names like Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Peter Altenberg, and Stefan George. But whatever human clay helped supply their quirks, the Enthusiasm Society amounts to a diverse repository of absurd writerly and creative types, reflected in their range of ages and specialties: in addition to poets, there\u2019s a dramatist, two actors, a novelist, and a critic. \u201cWe are simply artists,\u201d is how they are introduced to the pliant, clean-shaven Saxberger. Oblivious Romantics in a modernizing world, they say things like \u201cI write what I have to,\u201d \u201cYou, too, have been destroyed by the public,\u201d and \u201cI will permit myself to send you my \u2018Zenobia\u2019?\u201d An oppressive heat and smokiness fills their favored coffeehouse. \u201cI\u2019ve been running around town all afternoon\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.\u00a0something has to be done\u00a0.\u2009.\u2009.\u00a0people have to know about us,\u201d an irritable ballad-writer declares, vocalizing the wider ache to be noticed. This being before social media, a solution is devised in the form of a reading. They find a site normally reserved for carnivals and small dances. Here, old literary work can mingle seamlessly with the unfinished, and the collective can be launched with a manifesto. (It\u2019s titled \u201cWhat We Want\u201d and, in fact, airs one member\u2019s grievances while being ghostwritten totally by another.) The plan is for Saxberger, benign and verifiably gray-haired, to bestow his would-be grandeur on this motley and largely unpublished troupe.", "The story of a resurfacing or uncovered maestro ideally hangs on a new work, and Saxberger is asked to come up with new poems for the event. For decades, the office clerk has read only newspapers and the odd commercial novel, preferring to spend his off time at the local bar (the Pickled Pear), chatting at a safe remove and keeping score of others\u2019 billiards games. With the need to actually dispense some ink, his passive new daydream of fame becomes annoyingly cantilevered to reality. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that \u2018The Wanderings\u2019 unknown enough?\u201d he says as he tries to defend himself. Saxberger\u2019s plight is a test of age that stirs up pangs of lost youth, and steps from pure satire into the tragicomic. Any self-doubting creative struggle may look much like another, and the elusiveness of \u201cthe right atmosphere\u201d can force a genuine reckoning with limits for anyone. Similarly, Saxberger, beset with pleas to comment on others\u2019 work, shows a mixture of aversion and subjectivity that is both laughable and plausibly lifelike. Considering a book of poems by the Enthusiasm Society\u2019s young chief organizer, Meier, Saxberger wonders if it\u2019s as good as his own, while admitting to himself that he\u2019s unable to make heads or tails of it. (This doesn\u2019t stop him from bluffing and, in offering some objections, delighting in the feeling that he is \u201cgaining a greater and greater ascendancy\u201d over the author\u2014a staple of literary power games everywhere.)"], "title": "A Brilliant 1895 Novel on the Emptiness of Literary Fame", "by": "lermontov", "score": 63, "time": 1525290390, "top_comment": {"kids": [16988623, 16989031, 16989417, 16991731], "parent": 16980503, "text": "If you\u2019ve ever had first hand experience with being in an artistic&#x2F;creative \u201cscene\u201d a lot of this is familiar.

The keyboard consists of a PCB, plastic spacers, a 20 pin ribbon cable, custom made keyboard stabilizers, Costar stabs,\u00a03D printed keycap adapters, some resistors, a few capacitors, two IC\u2019s, a heap of microswitches and a black acrylic board for mounting everything. So quite a few components went into the project along with a looong list of parts and ideas that were eventually discarded before final decisions were made. This is how the first protoype was created!", "I started out by measuring the physical locations of the keys to ensure that everything would line up nicely and fit in both types of Commodore 64 cases (breadboxes and the newer C64C cases).

For this task I used\u00a0Sprint Layout (link) as it allows a JPEG image to be placed underneath the circuit, hereby making it easier to align everything correctly. Two 20 pin headers were placed at two different locations on the board. The older long boards have the connection on the left side while all short boards and the C64 Reloaded/Ultimate 64 have the connection further to the right.\u00a0This way a short 15-20 cm ribbon cable can be used for connecting the keyboard to the C64 motherboard.", "This is how the keyboard layout looks like as well as the copper traces and the first PCB prototype drawing.", "I wanted to use Cherry mx red microswitches as these resemble the feel of the original c64 keyboard.\u00a0In this context, Cherry mx switches come in two variations; plate mounted and PCB mounted.

This is what a guy on Deskthority has done previously when he made a replacement USB keyboard to fit inside a C64 breadbox, the MeC64 (link). However, maintenance, modifications and/or repairs of this approach is quite difficult because all switches have to be un-soldered in order to fix whatever needs fixing.

The two worked keenly on the task, and Synofzik experimented with settings from 1 to 5 volts.

Because of the significant amount of reverse engineering required and the advent of Rowhammer mitigations in some newer phones, the PoC currently works only on a Nexus 5 phone, which Google discontinued in 2015.

Yet he failed to anticipate two of the biggest developments of the 20th century\u2014the rise of fascism and the welfare state\u2014and wrongly believed communism would take root in the most advanced economies. Today\u2019s only successful self-styled Marxist regime is an enthusiastic practitioner of capitalism (or \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d).", "Yet for all his oversights, Marx remains a monumental figure. At the 200th anniversary of his birth, which falls on May 5th, interest in him is as lively as ever. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, is visiting Trier, Marx\u2019s birthplace, where a statue of Marx donated by the Chinese government will be unveiled. The British Library, where he did the research for \u201cDas Kapital\u201d, is putting on a series of exhibitions and talks. And publishers are producing a cascade of books on his life and thought, from \u201cDas Kapital\u201d-sized doorstops (Sven-Eric Liedman\u2019s \u201cA World to Win: The Life and Works of Karl Marx\u201d), to Communist Manifesto-slim pamphlets (a second edition of Peter Singer\u2019s \u201cMarx: A Very Short Introduction\u201d).", "Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.", "None of these bicentennial books is outstanding. The best short introduction is still Isaiah Berlin\u2019s \u201cKarl Marx\u201d, which was published in 1939. But the sheer volume of commentary is evidence of something important. Why does the world remain fixated on the ideas of a man who helped to produce so much suffering?", "The obvious reason is the sheer power of those ideas. Marx may not have been the scientist that he thought he was. But he was a brilliant thinker: he developed a theory of society driven forward by economic forces\u2014not just by the means of production but by the relationship between owners and workers\u2014and destined to pass through certain developmental stages. He was also a brilliant writer. Who can forget his observation that history repeats itself, \u201cthe first time as tragedy, the second as farce\u201d? His ideas were as much religious as scientific\u2014you might even call them religion repackaged for a secular age. He was a latter-day prophet describing the march of God on Earth. The fall from grace is embodied in capitalism; man is redeemed as the proletariat rises up against its exploiters and creates a communist utopia."], "dead": true, "id": 16989702, "score": 27, "time": 1525379819, "top_comment": {"kids": [16990223, 16991639], "parent": 16989702, "text": "Marx&#x27;s comments on capitalism are still useful.

It was conceived by photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge in 1879 (and built for him by January 1880 to project his famous chronophotographic pictures in motion and thus prove that these were authentic). Muybridge used the projector in his public lectures from 1880 to 1895. The projector used 16\" glass disks onto which Muybridge had an unidentified artist paint the sequences as silhouettes. This technique eliminated the backgrounds and enabled the creation of fanciful combinations and additional imaginary elements. Only one disk used photographic images, of a horse skeleton posed in different positions. A later series of 12\" discs, made in 1892\u20131894, used outlines drawn by Erwin F. Faber that were printed onto the discs photographically, then colored by hand. These colored discs were probably never used in Muybridge's lectures. All images of the known 71 disks, including those of the photographic disk, were rendered in elongated form to compensate the distortion of the projection. The projector was related to other projecting phenakistiscopes and used some slotted metal shutter discs that were interchangeable for different picture disks or different effects on the screen. The machine was hand-cranked.[1][2]", "The device appears to have been one of the primary inspirations for Thomas Edison and William Kennedy Dickson's Kinetoscope, the first commercial film exhibition system.[3] Images from all of the known seventy-one surviving zoopraxiscope discs have been reproduced in the book Eadweard Muybridge: The Kingston Museum Bequest (The Projection Box, 2004).", "...it is the first apparatus ever used, or constructed, for synthetically demonstrating movements analytically photographed from life, and in its resulting effects is the prototype of the various instruments which, under a variety of names, are used for a similar purpose at the present day.", "As stipulated in Muybridge's will the original machine and disks in his possession were left to Kingston upon Thames, where they are still kept in the Kingston Museum Muybridge Bequest Collection (except for four discs that are in other collections, including those of the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise and the National Technical Museum in Prague).[1][2]", "Muybridge also produced a series of 50 different paper 'Zoopraxiscope discs' (basically phenakistiscopes), again with pictures drawn by Erwin F. Faber. The discs were intended for sale at the 1893 World's Fair at Chicago, but seem to have sold very poorly and are quite rare. The discs were printed in black-and-white, with twelve different discs also produced as chromolithographed versions.

[Lynn Noel]The life in us is like the water in the river. It may rise this year higher than man has ever known it, and flood the parched uplands. \u2014 Henry David Thoreau, WaldenAlthough he is now remembered mostly as a romantic nature writer, in his own time and place Henry David Thoreau was a highly trained, well regarded, disciplined though eccentric land surveyor. 1 In the summer of 1859, he stood under a willow beside the Concord River contemplating a gash he had cut low in the tree\u2019s trunk, to gauge the water level. 2 In 22 miles the Concord fell only 32 inches \u2014 it was very nearly a pond \u2014 and any additional water heaved the river up and over its banks, before gravity\u2019s current slowly siphoned it out to sea. Yet flooding wasn\u2019t necessarily a problem. Indeed, the annual springtime deluge was the town\u2019s lifeblood, because the waters always rolled back, leaving behind a thick, black, nutrient-rich muck spread all across the bottomlands, whose field grasses grew fat and sleek on nature\u2019s bounty, perfect fodder for the farming town\u2019s livestock. 3But in 1798, in the predawn haze of the industrial era, the Middlesex Canal Corporation downstream at Billerica raised the height of an old mill dam that had been slung across the river, setting off a century-long fight for control of this resource. When the dam was upgraded again in 1851, it jacked the water level unnaturally high through Concord, well into the summer, ruining the hay, threatening the farmers\u2019 livelihood, and setting in motion a wave of lawsuits and petitions to the state legislature, which always seemed to be resolved in the interest of the mills and their capitalist owners. 4And so a riddle threaded its way through Concord: what is the best use of a river? Thoreau, the eccentric land surveyor,\u00a0was hired to answer it.At the root of each dispute over the river\u2019s water was an argument over the meaning of improvement and its near cousin, progress. Improvement could mean the cultivation and refinement of human qualities, but it also had a material connotation. To improve the earth was to mix one\u2019s own labor with it, to cultivate wild nature and thereby claim it as one\u2019s own. This was the preferred usage of the \u201cimprovers,\u201d those farmers who advocated for a scientific approach to husbandry that emphasized conservation, personal rectitude, and practices akin to what we might now call permaculture. There were improvers throughout Concord, and they even had an organization, the Concord Farmers\u2019 Club. 5Yet even then the word was diverging from its agrarian roots, developing something of its current flavor: economic advancement enabled by new technologies. 6 And Concord\u2019s improvers found themselves surrounded on all sides by lovers of Progress, because Thoreau\u2019s corner of Massachusetts was also ground zero for American industrial capitalism and, specifically, for the textile mills that powered this country\u2019s Industrial Revolution. 7In the early 1850s, the Billerica dam passed into the hands of a textile-factory owner named Charles Talbot, and soon after, upstream farmers noticed that the floods flooded deeper and longer than ever. However much Talbot\u2019s dam checked the flow of the already-languid river, its effect was magnified by the dozens of mills that periodically released their wastewater into the river, in effect flooding Concord from both ends. The growing city of Boston had also begun to draw water from the overworked Concord watershed, and to compensate country folks the Boston Water Board had constructed ponds up and down the river\u2019s spine whose timed releases kept the water levels uniformly high, even during periods of drought. 8 Farmers were predictably incensed by all of this and convinced that the industrialists conspired to swamp their livelihoods.And so a riddle threaded its way through Concord: what is the best use of a river? To power mills that would churn out cheap commodities, aid the growth of towns, yield fantastic profits for their owners, and help usher in an age of modern industrial capitalism; or, as Concord\u2019s farmers argued, to grow a productive, profitable, improved farming landscape? 9 That was the question that Thoreau, standing in the shade of the riverside willow, had been hired to answer.Henry David Thoreau. [Wikimedia]It\u2019s not entirely clear where Thoreau learned the art of surveying, or why, but he came to pursue it with an obsessed intensity. 10 Already by the 1840s, he was exploring the farthest and most arcane corners of the discipline \u2014 the unsolved mysteries of terrestrial magnetism; the best, most finicky methods of ensuring a compass\u2019s accuracy. He was a passionate scholar, whose research went far beyond the daily tasks of measuring property boundaries and town lines, laying out woodlots, and planning roads. 11 His obsession with accuracy and variation had gained him a reputation as one of the town\u2019s premier surveyors.It\u2019s not entirely clear where Thoreau learned the art of surveying, or why, but he came to pursue it with an obsessed intensity.Surveying also allowed him to pursue his love, the Concord River, and to learn its daily rhythms, its hardly-noticed secrets. The river was wild and ultimately unknowable, and yet Thoreau was convinced that surveying would help him fix its living likeness. On June 4, 1859, he was commissioned by Simon Brown, an elite, improvement-minded farmer who chaired the Committee of the Proprietors of the Sudbury and Concord River Meadows, an organization which had arisen in response to Talbot\u2019s grass-killing dam and with hopes that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\u2019s newly appointed Joint Special Committee, which had been formed to investigate the flooding, would finally rule in the farmers\u2019 favor. 12 Thoreau was to measure and catalog the width of each bridge that crossed the Concord between Sudbury and Billerica, the characteristics of every pier that might jut its obstructing pylons into the water, the history of each bridge\u2019s construction and improvement, and the character of the falls at Billerica itself. Brown\u2019s committee hoped these measurements would help prove that \u201cthe great oppression and spoliation to which we and our fathers have been so long subjected\u201d was not the result of sluggish nature but the fault of industry (and, specifically, of Talbot\u2019s dam). 13Over the next two months, Thoreau spent 34 days on the river, often accompanied by his friend William Ellery Channing. He sounded the bottom in hundreds of places \u2014 stopping every thousand feet over a distance of more than 25 miles \u2014 and saw with his mind\u2019s eye the river bottom from the side, saw its gullies and hills. 14 He also plunged into the town archives, searching out maps he should consult and local citizens whose long memories he could mine for crucial information. 15 At the end of the project, he took his 33 pages of detailed notes and boiled them down to a single oversize chart. 16 His neighbor Ralph Waldo Emerson was in a huff over what he saw as wasted time spent away from the true work of writing: \u201cHenry T. occupies himself with the history of the river, measures it, weighs it, strains it through a colander to all eternity,\u201d the elder transcendentalist wrote to a mutual friend. 17Emerson was right to worry. Thoreau was zealously disciplined in his surveying, which isn\u2019t surprising, because most 19th-century manuals, including Thoreau\u2019s copy of Charles Davies\u2019s Elements of Surveying, demanded exacting precision, not only in one\u2019s instruments, but also in one\u2019s body and mind. 18 Surveying was as much a way to measure the land as it was a method of plotting the perfect, modern man: the would-be surveyor needed to be polished and upright; he needed \u201ca careful training of the eye and hand \u2026 the exercise of judgment in laying out and prosecuting the work \u2026 physical alacrity and endurance in the collection of the data. \u2026 In short, the requirements are such that only a person of good judgment, temperate habits, active temperament, and scholarly attainments can hope to excel in this profession,\u201d as one manual put it. 19Thoreau\u2019s drafting tools and surveying chain, exhibited at the Concord Museum. [Wikimedia]Thoreau and his willow tree were inheritors of a much longer history whose deep context was then spreading its way across the continent. Thousands of similar trees dotted the American landscape, inscribed by thousands of ax-wielding men. From the moment of European footfall, surveyors had tried to lash the chaotic, polyphonic story of the landscape into one coherent narrative.Though blazing a tree was as old as surveying itself, the connotation of every mark began to change with Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Ordinance of 1785, which sought to bring order to territorial expansion through a streamlined, efficient process of rationalized surveying and cartography. A new nation, in the New World, needed a method of self-invention. Americans, beginning with Jefferson, inscribed the national grid \u2014 which now stretches from the streets of Manhattan, across the checkerboard of the Great Plains, all the way to the beaches of California \u2014 onto the land. 20 Anchoring this imaginary, cross-hatched latticework were the witness trees standing sentinel at the corner of many six-mile-square townships, America\u2019s building block.Surveyors tried to lash the chaotic, polyphonic story of the landscape into one coherent narrative.The grid was powerfully abstracting: it transmuted real, impossibly complicated land into simple squares, all of which looked the same on a map; and the clarity it allowed was a welcome relief from the headaches, political intrigue, and disenfranchisement that attended the traditional system of settlement in Jefferson\u2019s South \u2014 a free-for-all of indiscriminate corruption by \u201csurveyors\u201d whose only claim to qualification was their claim to being qualified. In the colonial era, it was not uncommon for the same parcel of land to be sold to many different buyers at the same time, and legal wrangling over ownership clogged Southern courts for decades. 21 Jefferson\u2019s plan was to map the land before settlement, to pinpoint its resources and divide the nation\u2019s territory into uniform squares, then to parcel them out intelligently to deserving yeoman farmers. 22But if abstraction brings clarity and connection to disparate things flung across great distances, it can do so only through severing the tangled roots that plot any thing in a local place. Abstraction is a way of saying that some general connections matter and that others, the more specific ones, don\u2019t. What must be ignored in order to think that a parcel of land in one place is like a similarly sized parcel anywhere else? One way to answer that question is to look at what was abstracted out of the picture \u2014 people: squatters, wanderers, and, above all else, American Indians; and also topography, flora and fauna, ecology.That perfect grid of mitotic squares, spreading out effortlessly into the sunset, helped give Americans the idea that the continent was empty.That perfect grid of mitotic squares, spreading out effortlessly into the sunset, helped give Americans the idea that the continent was empty, the land free for the taking as long as a well-trained property surveyor was near at hand. 23 Jefferson had hoped that his abstraction would roll democracy and his chosen people into one tight landscape of liberty, but he hadn\u2019t adequately reckoned with the metastasizing forces of capital, and it didn\u2019t take long for the economic elite to grasp that Jefferson\u2019s grid could be folded into a funnel to efficiently siphon off the wealth of an entire continent. All landscapes serve somebody\u2019s purpose.Once abstraction had standardized the landscape and imaginatively emptied it of all prior claims, the profit-hungry could reconstitute land as yet another fungible product to be traded on the open market. This is the point of commoditization, a special kind of abstraction: every sack of grain, every board foot of lumber, every gallon of oil, every good, is stripped of its individuality and imagined to be exactly like every other in its class. 24 Between Jefferson\u2019s time and Thoreau\u2019s, it became increasingly possible to shift one\u2019s attention from the content of the landscape to its borders, from the productive value of the land to its exchange value as a unit.\u201cThe striking and peculiar characteristic of American society,\u201d observed the French political scientist \u00c9mile Boutmy, in 1891, \u201cis that it is not so much a democracy as a huge commercial company for the discovery, cultivation, and capitalization of its enormous territory.\u201d 25 In fact, the very first big-business trust in America, from the late 18th century, was a real-estate outfit named the North American Land Company. 26Plan of John B. Moore\u2019s Farm, Concord, Mass, surveyed by Thoreau in 1853, with annotations in red ink by Albert E. Wood in 1886. [Courtesy of the American Antiquarian Society]Several years before his river survey, in the fall of 1851, Thoreau had resurveyed Concord\u2019s town line. It was an old New England tradition for the town\u2019s selectmen to walk the boundaries once a year and reacquaint themselves with the sentinel trees, but this was the first time they had chosen to include a surveyor in their number. 27 Though Thoreau didn\u2019t let on to it, he was excited, even honored, to be asked, and he put the adventure down twice in his journals: once in the surveying notebook that he had been keeping since 1849, using disciplined surveyor\u2019s prose \u2014 \u201cperambulated the line between Concord and Acton, from a split stone near Paul Dudleys\u201d \u2014 but also a second time in his personal journal:Commenced perambulating the town bounds \u2026 Mr. \u2014 \u2014 told a story of his wife walking in the fields somewhere, and, to keep the rain off, throwing her gown over her head and holding it in her mouth, and so being poisoned about her mouth from the skirts of her dress having come in contact with poisonous plants \u2026 \u2014 \u2014 described the wall about or at Forest Hills Cemetery in Roxbury as being made of stones upon which they were careful to preserve the moss, so that it cannot be distinguished from a very old wall.Found one intermediate bound-stone near the powder-mill drying-house on the bank of the river. The worker-men there wore shoes without iron tacks. He said that the kernel-house was the most dangerous, the drying-house next, the press-house next. One of the powder-mill buildings in Concord? The potato vines and the beans which were still green are now blackened and flattened by the frost. 28A funny thing happened to Thoreau every time he looked at his compass: his mind strayed from its close focus on straight lines, and then he was off, expertly wandering, running seemingly unconnected things \u2014 gossip, stone walls, labor exploitation, phenology \u2014 all together, creating a subjective, historical, experiential patchwork of a map at the very same time that he was employed as the legal guardian of the town\u2019s boundaries. 29 His journal entries tell of death\u2019s economic balance sheet: powder leveled troops as well as mountains and forests. (\u201cThe willow reach by Lee\u2019s Bridge has been stripped for powder,\u201d he wrote, a month before the walk with the selectmen.) 30 They tell us of commerce and communication with the larger port city of Boston. We learn that poisonous plants grow, and we hear what might be a bit of loose talk, or possibly a morality tale about vanity, or maybe a lesson about the loss of local, rooted knowledge; we hear of early efforts at historic preservation. We learn that workers in the powder mills \u2014 who were helping to make munitions for the Mexican-American War \u2014 wore shoes without hobnails so that the simple human act of walking, of striking one\u2019s feet on the ground, wouldn\u2019t kick up sparks. And finally, Thoreau took the time to record the change of seasons, to notice that the window in which certain crops could thrive was shuttered tight against the cold.No matter how precise one\u2019s instrumentation, a well-trained mind will always stumble upon the unknown, the fantastic, the enchanted.His journals are filled with such moments, and he learned to survey in order that he might discover how to get lost; to triangulate between nature and humankind; to pinpoint the connections that emplace a person in a deep context at once cultural, economic, and natural; to find himself. \u201cThe boundaries of the actual are no more fixed and rigid than the elasticity of our imaginations,\u201d Thoreau wrote in 1853, and the deliberate, blending, countermodern confusion he sowed between inanimate property and living creatures is a key to how he used his compass, and what for. 31 At the heart of his observations there is always a sense of wonder, an acknowledgment that no matter how precise one\u2019s instrumentation, a well-trained mind will always stumble upon the unknown, the fantastic, the enchanted. 32Simon Brown and his fellow improvers hired Thoreau because he was exact, and they hoped that his skill would keep the river in their control. 33 They were right; they won. 34 But Thoreau took the job so that he could spend time with one of his muses. \u201cFor the first time it occurred to me this afternoon what a piece of wonder a river is,\u201d he wrote, in one of his very first journal entries, in the spring of 1838. \u201cA huge volume of matter ceaselessly rolling through the fields and meadows of this substantial earth.\u201d He was clearly in love. 35 Two decades later, he knew that piece of wonder intimately. He had filled his journal with hundreds of entries on the river\u2019s height and temperature, which he would continue to monitor until he could no longer leave his bachelor\u2019s bed, when he was dying of the tuberculosis that had been aggravated by a bitterly cold day spent counting the rings of trees.Textile mills in Lowell, Massachusetts, at the confluence of the Concord and Merrimack Rivers. Detail from a painting by John Badger Bachelder, 1856.Though he never did finally settle on whether he thought the flooding of Concord\u2019s meadows was anthropogenic or not, Thoreau had no doubt that the flow was artificially influenced. 36 Back in 1854, he had observed that the river remained fairly high even in periods of drought. 37 And while surveying for the Committee of the Proprietors in 1859, his willow tree told him a curious thing: the river had risen without a single drop of rainfall. 38 So, over the course of the summer, he took hundreds of readings of the water level at various times every day, until he discovered that the river had an irregularly rhythmic pulse. Of course, that pulse wasn\u2019t the river\u2019s at all, but the action of the upstream mills, pumping their floods during the workday and holding them back at night and on weekends. 39The river was an organic machine, a river rationalized \u2014 gridded, even \u2014 to serve the interests of capital. Thoreau, miserable, describes a body \u201cso completely emasculated and demoralized \u2026 that it is even made to observe the Christian Sabbath.\u201d 40By a gauge set in the river I can tell about what time the millers on the stream and its tributaries go to work in the morning and leave off at night, and also can distinguish the Sundays, since it is the day on which the river does not rise, but falls. If I had lost the day of the week, I could recover it by a careful examination of the river. It lies by in the various mill-ponds on Sunday and keeps the Sabbath. What its persuasion is, is another question. 41But just here, at the main revelation, Thoreau got sidetracked again and wandered away from the desolate gloom of his statistics toward an uncaulked chink where hope streamed in. What is a river\u2019s persuasion? He knew, from years of painstaking measurement, that water always forces its own course, and that the path of least resistance sometimes leads directly through the most concrete redoubt of Progress: \u201cWho knows what may avail a crow-bar against the Billerica dam,\u201d Thoreau wrote, back in 1849, in a book-length poem about the river. 42 Years later, he discovered that the sympathetic river had beaten him to the punch. On a visit to another dam, he found himself \u201camused with the various curves of water which leak through at different heights. \u2026 The dam leaked in a hundred places between and under the planks, and there were as many jets of various size and curve.\u201d 43\u201cIt excites me to see early in the spring that black artery leaping once more through the snow-clad town,\u201d he wrote. His faith had taken a knock from his findings but had not, ultimately, succumbed to the logic of surveying. \u201cAll is tumult and life there, not to mention the rails and cranberries that are drifting in it. Where this artery is shallowest, i.e., comes nearest to the surface and runs swiftest, there it shows itself soonest and may see its pulse beat. There are the wrists, temples of the earth. Where I feel its pulse with my eye. The living waters.\u201d 44 The river was alive, wild, even if it had been calmed by the regulation of the mills. Precision again led him to bewilderment, fact to a flowing unknown. \u201cMen are inclined to be amphibious, to sympathize with fishes, now,\u201d he wrote, on another occasion, in a joyful spirit of boundary crossing. 45Satellite images of American land use and development from The Jefferson Grid, a collection on Tumblr and Instagram.The ultimate problem with abstraction is that it relies always on violence. One of the word\u2019s many meanings is \u201cto steal,\u201d and one of the purposes of the 19th-century\u2019s federal land surveys was to prepare land for stealing. 46 The army had its own corps of engineers, which was reorganized in 1838 to better reconnoiter the continent\u2019s people and its exploitable natural resources. Between 1842 and 1845, John C. Fr\u00e9mont, the flamboyant, self-promoting explorer who would take the name \u201cPathfinder\u201d when he ran for president a decade later \u2014 under the campaign slogan \u201cFree Soil, Free Men, and Fr\u00e9mont\u201d \u2014 embarked on a series of secret missions to help make the developing narrative of violent annexation appear inevitable, natural, divinely sanctioned. 47 After the gun smoke cleared and the earth soaked in all the blood it could hold, the surveyors arrived with their squares, rewriting history, declaring the land open, empty, and free for democracy.After the gun smoke cleared and the earth soaked in all the blood it could hold, the surveyors arrived with their squares.Jefferson\u2019s grid helped knit slavery ever deeper into the nation\u2019s fabric. In those red-hot years of Manifest Destiny, following the Mexican-American War, slavers streamed west. It was Anglo slaveholders in northern Mexico who goaded Texas to revolution in 1835, and it was the prospect of some 270,000 square miles of slave-worked Lone Star land that helped push the United States toward war. Once the shooting was done, slave owners could enjoy an unbroken view from Florida all the way to the borders of free-state California, and what they saw was the promise of fortune. 48Cotton production exploded during Thoreau\u2019s lifetime, from 80 million bales in 1811 to well over a billion at the time of his death. All that cotton was grown on land abstracted away from others, and picked by stolen labor. Nearly a million slaves, commodified bodies, were marched west out of the Upper South between 1790 and 1860. 49 Much of the cotton they picked and cleaned was shipped to textile mills in England, but some of it went to Massachusetts, where the Lowell mills alone consumed 100,000 days of enslaved people\u2019s labor every year, and some of that white fleece found its way farther upstream, to a mill along the banks of the Concord River, whose dam backed the water up ever closer to a willow tree with a notch cut low in its trunk, under which stood a surveyor, thinking. 50When Thoreau looked down the river, he saw a current congealed by a factory in which weary humans toiled to make cloth from cotton picked by slaves and grown on land won through violent dispossession. He saw a world that he loved collide with Progress, a landscape ruled by the profit motive. \u201cThis world is a place of business,\u201d he elaborated in \u201cLife without Principle.\u201d He continued, \u201cI think there is nothing, not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay, to life itself\u201d \u2014 a landscape of violent abstraction, of gridded lives, land, and water, a place of thievery where everything complicated, unique, and wonderful was put up for sale. 51Thoreau\u2019s genius lay in seeing the invisible, countermodern connections between things.Thoreau\u2019s genius lay in seeing the invisible, countermodern connections between things; but what use is talent if it can\u2019t be shared? Though he was gifted with rare powers of observation, he struggled to make them apparent to others. There\u2019s no one text or chart where Thoreau ever plainly plotted the intersection of land, labor, and capital; the meeting ground of Southern chattel slavery and the Northern wage system; the overlapping territory of machine, cotton, and surveying. He could feel the connections, he knew they were there, but his writing remained archipelagic.What separated Thoreau from many of his politically radical peers was his insight that free trade and slavery, the mill and the factory, territorial expansion and offensive war and demoralized rivers, all were rooted in a peculiar kind of landscape. Thoreau had gone to Walden in 1845, the year Manifest Destiny entered the American vocabulary, a year when his surveying interests were growing into a passion, in order to \u201cdrive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world.\u201d 52 He went searching for meanness, and of course found it, for if the culture of capitalism fed in part on reconceiving of nature as natural resources, it grew fat on reducing people to mere functions. 53 Yet life, as it must, endured. \u201cI have thus surveyed the country on every side within a dozen miles of where I live,\u201d he wrote, and what he discovered was sublime: he found the wild. 54Wildness, a quality, and wilderness, a place, are not the same things.Unfortunately, there is perhaps no way Thoreau has been more misunderstood than as an advocate for a wilderness without humans. 55 \u201cIn wildness is the preservation of the world,\u201d he famously wrote, in his ever-unfinishable essay \u201cWalking,\u201d a line that is still misquoted as a defense of untouched wilderness. 56 But wildness, a quality, and wilderness, a place, are not the same things. 57 Wildness gives life its character \u2014 \u201cLife consists with wildness. The most alive is the wildest\u201d \u2014 it is the underground current sustaining all nature, including all human nature. 58 Wildness is what pulsed through Thoreau and the leaping black artery of the Concord; wildness is why, in Walden, Thoreau was able to count mice, phoebes, ants, loons, a \u201cwinged cat,\u201d ducks, and dozens of animal others among his neighbors, and runaway slaves as his visitors. 59 \u201cAll good things are wild and free,\u201d he wrote in \u201cWalking,\u201d an essay that also happens to seethe with scorn for capitalist surveying. 60If Thoreau thought that in wildness the world could be preserved, it was because the wild was a landscape where \u201cno fugitive slave laws are passed,\u201d because the wild planted every human as \u201can inhabitant, or part and parcel of Nature,\u201d because the wild grows untamed and always threatens the abstract orderliness of the grid. 61 Thoreau had chased life into a corner, and when he did, he saw that the market\u2019s abstractions were neither natural nor inevitable. Yet, perhaps Thoreau boasted a bit much. Perhaps he didn\u2019t chase life, but instead was led by the hand until, alone together, life turned to face its follower. When it did, Thoreau felt his own boundaries fade and float out on the day\u2019s light. \u201cThe life in us is like the water in the river,\u201d he wrote in Walden\u2019s conclusion. \u201cIt may rise this year higher than man has ever known it, and flood the parched uplands.\u201d 62Concord River. [Richard Ellis]What is the best use of a river? That\u2019s the question that Simon Brown and his committee had hired Thoreau to find out, and I\u2019m sure they had little patience for wildness, or wandering, or border-bending metaphors, or any of the other transcendental things for which Thoreau used his surveying skills. Concord\u2019s other farmers wanted legally defensible maps and tables of statistics. Thoreau knew this; he complied with his employers\u2019 wishes and was paid, and then he found himself crossing into the monochromatic kingdom of despair. He fretted over the deadening effect that measurement played on his mind. 63 It was the surveyor\u2019s job to abstract, after all, to produce a map claiming to capture something essential, something real about the earth; but Thoreau worried that in gaining a critical distance he was losing the world. 64\u2018How little there is on an ordinary map,\u2019 Thoreau wrote. Blank spaces irritated him, because they weren\u2019t, in fact, blank.\u201cHow little there is on an ordinary map,\u201d Thoreau wrote, soon after finishing his work for Simon Brown. \u201cHow little, I mean that concerns the walker and lover of nature. Between those lines indicating roads is a plain blank space in the form of a square or triangle or polygon or segment of a circle, and there is naught to distinguish this from another area of similar size and form.\u201d 65 These blank spaces irritated Thoreau, because they weren\u2019t, in fact, blank, and his famously circuitous writing can be seen as a literary effort both to picture the landscape more truthfully and to confound a map\u2019s simpleminded linearity. 66 It\u2019s a bitter irony, then, that what Thoreau produced for the Committee of the Proprietors was the ultimate abstract landscape: a wilderness of statistics.Thoreau wasn\u2019t asked to produce a map for the committee, because its members already had one, and he came to know it well. 67 It had been drawn in 1834 by B. F. Perham, under the supervision of the highly regarded surveyor Loammi Baldwin, and in 1859 it was still considered legally up to date. Its greatest strength was its generic beauty. It was a map that looked like any other, a map that outlined the river\u2019s arcing course, the area\u2019s political boundaries, the towns\u2019 notable buildings. It had five bridges and, at the very top, the river\u2019s notable statistics: length, 22 miles, 802 feet; vertical fall, 2.865 feet. It confidently offered itself as objective, naturalistic, reliable, passive, a true transcript of raw, uninhabited space. All of it aggravated Thoreau.Where are the people, he wondered? Where are the fields and the trees and the homes and the roads and the stores? Where are the landscape\u2019s other inhabitants \u2014 the plants, the animals, all the things every bit as real as the river and courthouse and political boundaries? 68 Where, he must have asked himself, am I?Where are the people, he wondered? Where are the fields and the trees and the homes and the roads and the stores?On July 7, 1859, Thoreau was poring over the Baldwin-Perham map, filling his journal with measurement tables and all kinds of statistical minutiae. 69 He listed all of the bridges, and then corrected the names that Baldwin and Perham got wrong. 70 At some point, he became disillusioned not only with Baldwin but also with the mute stupidity of his own statistical table. What could a column of numbers have to say about a living river that was worth hearing?And so Thoreau improved the time: \u201cI [am] reminded of the advantage of the poet, and philosopher, and naturalist, and whomsoever, of pursuing from time to time some other business than his chosen one, \u2014 seeing with the side of the eye. The poet will so get visions which no deliberate abandonment can secure. The philosopher is so forced to recognize principles which long study might not detect. And the naturalist even will stumble upon some new and unexpected flower or animal.\u201d 71 Improve was one of Thoreau\u2019s favorite verbs, but he meant something very different from either the agricultural improvers or their industrial antagonists. \u201cI hate the present modes of living and getting a living,\u201d Thoreau had written in 1855, and for him improvement meant living rather than getting one. 72 It meant being present, aware of the birdsongs, the taste of the river, the character of the breeze; it meant being alive and sensitive to one\u2019s living surroundings. 73 It meant, in July 1859, making a map.\u201c(Exact) Positions (of depth) less certain \u2014 bottom soft.\u201d Detail of Thoreau\u2019s 1859 plan of the Concord River. [See the full map online at the Concord Free Public Library]Thoreau began by tracing the outlines of Baldwin\u2019s and Perham\u2019s map and then reusing them for his own. 74 But the similarities end at the sketched-in river\u2019s banks, for Thoreau\u2019s map is alive with a riot of thousands of tiny notations \u2014 most in variously hued pen\u2019s ink, but some, ghostly, in pencil \u2014 including particular comments about the river\u2019s current: \u201cshallow and quick\u201d in some places, \u201csandbars and grass,\u201d \u201csoft banks,\u201d in others. And there\u2019s a sense of the river\u2019s human use. Thoreau notes, just downstream from the Turnpike bridge, \u201c1st cottage,\u201d and just a little below, the \u201cboat pl.,\u201d from where he and his friend Channing began their riverine explorations. Elsewhere he marks the good swimming holes. He points out the cultural and historical geography of the river: where an old hay bridge once stood, where one might find freshwater clams, the monument to the battles of Lexington and Concord in 1776. And he carefully details, in scores of places, what plants grow where: individual oak and ash trees, polygonum, bulrush, and many others. 75 The sharp-eyed Thoreau had gained his townspeople\u2019s respect as an exacting surveyor, but here he was after something wilder. His map plunges its viewer headfirst into the chaotic mystery of a river called Concord, and it all begins in a cloud of cartographic disorientation with Thoreau\u2019s refusal to give the map a coherent name.Thoreau\u2019s seven-and-a-half-foot map plunges its viewer headfirst into the chaotic mystery of a river called Concord.The map is overwhelmingly long \u2014 seven-and-a-half feet \u2014 which means that its viewer actually has to walk its length, must reenact, in miniature, an afternoon\u2019s boating trip. It\u2019s a demanding map, and to get a grip on it, one must focus on the river itself, the only immediately apparent narrative thread. Not until the river\u2019s conclusion, where it crashes into Talbot\u2019s dam, do we stumble upon a title cordoned off in the lower right corner: Plan of Concord River from East Sudbury to Billerica Mills, 22.15 Miles, To be used on a trial in the S.J. Court, Sudbury and East Sudbury Meadow Corporation vs. Middlesex Canal, Taken by agreement of Parties by L. Baldwin, Civil Engineer. Surveyed & Drawn by B.F. Perham, May 1834. This was the exact title of Baldwin\u2019s and Perham\u2019s map, except they had put it front and center, in semaphoric letters that could not be missed. Thoreau then gave to his map an even smaller title, in a box at the center: Plan and Profile of that part of Concord River between Sudbury Causeway & the Canal Mill Dam in Billerica, Surveyed & the level taken in October 1811, and to be used in The Supreme Judicial Court, in an action then pending between D. Baldwin & J.L. Sullivan, pursuant to agreement of the parties. By L. Baldwin. Apparently, Baldwin had also mapped the river in 1811, for an earlier dispute over the river\u2019s height \u2014 a fact of which the Baldwin-Perham map makes no mention.A header with twin sets of statistics from both 1811 and 1834 runs across the entire top of the map. Those figures represented the river\u2019s fall over the course of its length, and they were the sort of scientific facts that \u201cmay dust the mind by their dryness,\u201d as Thoreau once complained. But they were oddly significant because they weren\u2019t even close to agreement. Baldwin had recorded the river\u2019s fall as 4 feet, 3.9 inches in the first case; and 2 feet, 10.38 inches some two decades later. 76 Both could not be right. As it turns out, Baldwin had been hoodwinked back in 1811. Before he could set up his instruments, the Billerica dam\u2019s owners had thrown open the floodgates to artificially inflate the river\u2019s fall and clear the way for capitalism\u2019s rising tide.Baldwin\u2019s folly was public knowledge by the 1850s, but Thoreau refused to let the point go. 77 Instead, he drove home the tenuous connection between map and terrain by including both sets of statistics. He cared less about the inaccuracy of the earlier map than he did about how easily a map can distort reality. To guard against the chance that anyone might misread his own fantastic map of conjoined titles and twinned measurements, Thoreau came up with a raving-mad scale to rule his landscape: \u201c60 rods to the inch & B[aldwin]\u2019s is 2/3 of a division of my scale longer than Perham\u2019s.\u201d 78The map\u2019s resistance to utilitarian clarity is the same resistance with which all living things meet the violence of abstraction.It is tempting to read Thoreau\u2019s river survey as a satirical anti-map, a snide rejection of disciplinary pretension that leaves its viewer wallowing in relativism. How could anyone measure anything with a tripolar scale whose differing notions of what an inch is babble over each other? But irony is only one of the tropes that Thoreau drew on. He was always more interested in improvement than deconstruction, and his countermodern map is affirming in its self-aware subjectivity, its desire to picture Concord as situated in a landscape teeming with life and human usage. This was a political choice. If Baldwin\u2019s and Perham\u2019s Concord River is anonymous and untouched and dead, an ahistorical space that denies change, a river that can be manipulated and controlled; then all those notes pinpointing where the plants grew, all those piles of figures and ghosts of surveys past, make of Thoreau\u2019s a deep map \u2014 a view of an impressively interconnected world where nature, commerce, culture, history, and imagination all grow together \u2014 something nonfungible and specific: a full, a wild land living at once beyond and beneath the confined landscape of the town\u2019s grasping improvers, both agricultural and industrial, who, despite their superficial differences, ultimately agreed that the best use of a river is to turn a profit. 79 Its resistance to utilitarian clarity is the same resistance with which all living things meet the violence of abstraction. It won\u2019t sit still but demands that you walk it, puzzle over it, bend close, look from afar, and leave it, bewildered.Perhaps wildness is always a trespasser disrespecting the artificial boundaries of power. \u201cThey who laid out the town should have made the river available as a common possession forever,\u201d Thoreau wrote near the end of his life, in his great anti-capitalist essay \u201cHuckleberries\u201d; and he used all his surveying skill to stake a claim for the bulrush and the ash tree, for the bathers and those who hunted for freshwater clams, for himself and for all Concordians in his map. 80 The river persuaded him to use his cartographic training as a means to protest the privatizing of the public goods that ought to benefit every living thing, to disavow the cheap utopian assurances of individual gain so dearly bought. Call it liberation cartography: \u201cI find that I have a civil right in the River,\u201d Thoreau wrote in 1853. Six years later he plated those claims on the map you can read here. 81", "The life in us is like the water in the river. It may rise this year higher than man has ever known it, and flood the parched uplands. \u2014 Henry David Thoreau, Walden", "Although he is now remembered mostly as a romantic nature writer, in his own time and place Henry David Thoreau was a highly trained, well regarded, disciplined though eccentric land surveyor. 1 In the summer of 1859, he stood under a willow beside the Concord River contemplating a gash he had cut low in the tree\u2019s trunk, to gauge the water level. 2 In 22 miles the Concord fell only 32 inches \u2014 it was very nearly a pond \u2014 and any additional water heaved the river up and over its banks, before gravity\u2019s current slowly siphoned it out to sea. Yet flooding wasn\u2019t necessarily a problem. Indeed, the annual springtime deluge was the town\u2019s lifeblood, because the waters always rolled back, leaving behind a thick, black, nutrient-rich muck spread all across the bottomlands, whose field grasses grew fat and sleek on nature\u2019s bounty, perfect fodder for the farming town\u2019s livestock. 3"], "descendants": 0, "by": "kawera", "score": 9, "time": 1525305958, "type": "story", "id": 16982228}, "523": {"kids": [16992538, 16992711, 16992617, 16993212, 16993100, 16992801, 16992400, 16995668, 16994061, 16993404, 16995134, 16993459, 16994788, 16992607, 16995981, 16994541, 16994730, 16993049, 16994449, 16994647, 16992704, 16993530, 16993549, 16993818, 16992560, 16994555, 16994354], "descendants": 132, "url": "http://www.rocketroberts.com/stereo/stereo.htm", "text": ["Updated  22 May 2014 \n\n<!--\ngoogle_ad_client = \"pub-5062213897397328\";\ngoogle_ad_width = 728;\ngoogle_ad_height = 90;\ngoogle_ad_format = \"728x90_as\";\ngoogle_ad_type = \"text_image\";\ngoogle_ad_channel = \"\";\n//-->\n\n\n\n\nA 1970's Teenager's Bedroom\n\nIntroduction: This page shows some of the evolution of my stereo system and involvement with electronics as a teenager in the mid 1970s.  The earliest pictures I have are from 1976, however I started with stereo systems in the early 70s.  The photos below are in \nchronological order. \n\nWhy this page? At work and in related travels, I often get questioned as to how I got started in electronics. Basically I started playing with batteries and light bulbs at around age 7 (1967). From there things went somewhat slowly until around 1974 when I got into stereo systems.  Rather than tell the detailed story many times over, I put together this page to illustrate how things got started for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA shot of the corner of my bedroom with the stereo system from July 1976.  A Harmon Kardon (Trio) tube amp is at the center of the system (this unit was 12 watts per channel).  To the right of it is a Halicrafters short-wave radio.  Above that is a Harmon Kardon (Rondo) mono tube tuner.  The lower turntable is a modified GE phonograph.  I got this phonograph in 1972 (had an old Grundig console before that but it died).  When I got the Harmon Kardon amp, I had to find a way to wire the turntable to work with the amp (of course compact phono has no provisions for external connections).  This was my first major (for the time) accomplishment, taking the phono and rewiring the cartridge output so that I could plug it into the amp.  It worked!   The other turntable (above the green GE) was a second one I obtained at a later time.  The three items above the system are homemade \"star dials\", these were motorized planispheres that showed what stars were up at any given time.  Two speakers can be seen here, and 8\" two way and (below) a 12\" two way system.  The lower system is homebuilt. Note the Pioneer SX-636 literature on the wall behind the equipment!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA photo of my newly upgraded speaker system.  Previously it was a 12\" two way system with a horn tweeter originally built in the fall of 1974.  Now (October 1976) it has been upgraded to a three way system including a midrange and dome tweeter.  The speaker components (woofer and midrange) are Radio Shack brand, however Utah made these speakers for Radio Shack. This system is all homemade, basically made of 1 x 12 pine boards cut with a skillsaw (I did not have any fancy woodworking tools at the time).  This system is still in use today, it is fine for low power (up to 30 watts or so) listening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view of the system corner, this image is from late 1976.  A new woofer can be seen in the 8\" two way system. A fan has been installed under the shelf to keep the tube amp cool, it is powered by a train transformer mounted on the wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1977.  A new Pioneer PL-112D turntable has been added (it was my big Christmas present for 1976).  Had to re-arrange a number of items to accommodate the new gear.  With the new turntable, my 45 record collection suffered much less wear (even though I had modified the old GE phono to track a lot lighter).  It also sounds a lot better!  One old turntable is now retired. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view from early 1977.  Note the pile of 45 records on the desk.  Also, the 8\" speaker system has a light installed (for special effects).  The bulb was wired in series with the woofer, and it flashed in accordance with the volume of sound.  Problem was, it blew out too often! \n\n\nAre you a speaker builder/audio hobbyist in need of parts?\u00a0\nPlease check out Parts Express,  a great source for all kinds of RF connectors, speakers, components, etc.   I sure wish they were around when I was building speakers in the 70s, they have a HUGE offereing of components!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1977.  An old Revere reel to reel recorder (salvaged from the town dump by my father) is now mounted on the wall.  This unit was from 1957 and despite having no cabinet, worked quite well.  It was only mono, but at 7 1/2 ips the sound was actually pretty good.  I had this recorder up until around 1999 when I finally retired it permanently.  40+ years of service out of a piece of gear... most of the junk sold today would be lucky to last 1/3 that long.  Things were built to last back then, this recorder was very well made and heavy.  Also visible in this photo is a Realistic multitester.  This item was very helpful in doing various measurements!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 1976.  A new 12\" 3-way system made from speakers salvaged from the East Longmeadow MA town dump.  One person's trash is another persons treasure!  Speaker cabinet was made out of particle board and painted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1977.  A new Kenwood KA-3500 (40 watts/channel) amp has been added to the system as of 17 May 1977, a major upgrade from the old tube amp (both amps are still in service in 2008). I earned the money for this amp (price was $139.99 at Lechmere) by making a stone walkway.  It was a LOT of work, had to locate and haul many large flat rocks to the area and set them in the ground.  Probably moved about 5000 pounds of rocks to make this walkway, and it is still there today (as is the amp)!  Also, a new shelf has been added to hold equipment that had to be rearranged. Also note that a Realistic SA-100C amplifier has been added.  This amp was originally owned by my neighbor Paul Goewey, he later sold it to my brother and then I bought it after that.  This amp was used for the Bugging System.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 1977.   Another layer of shelving (basically pine boards) has been added to support the added equipment.  Power Meters for the speakers have been added as well.  Mounted on the front of the shelf (right below a small Radio Shack amplifier) are a number of switches... these controlled what was known as the \"bugging system\".  I had numerous (at peak about 12) speakers (which also functioned as microphones) wired all around the house and property.  Using this system, I could monitor what was going on at remote locations, or send music to those same locations.  This system was crude by today's standards, but overall it worked quite well considering what I had to work with.  Note the power control switchbox on the wall above the Pioneer PL-112D turntable.  This was used to control things like the fans that cool the amp, the bugging system, etc. Clock radios have also been rearranged somewhat due to the expanding system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1977 photo.  Some of the speakers that were installed in various speaker systems I made. At top left is a Philips 12\" woofer with 40 oz magnet and 2\" voice coil (a fine woofer for its day).  At top right is a Radio Shack 12\" triaxial speaker... actually, these were made by Utah and sold by Radio Shack under the Americana name. This speaker I got in summer of 1977 at a \"Where-is-As-is\" sale (does anyone remember those)?  Unfortunately, they only had the one speaker, so I got it, hoping to locate another (I never did, but today on Ebay that are not uncommon).  At the lower right is a 12\" Radio Shack speaker that we used to call the \"eight dollar woofer\".  It was a speaker with minimal capabilities, a 12\" speaker with a 1\" voice coil and a 5 Oz magnet, but it only cost $8!  It was a great entry level speaker for those who could afford little but who wanted a \"big\" speaker sound.  It was basically a Utah PA speaker.  Finally, at lower left is a Radio Shack 12\" musical instrument speaker.  This too was basically a Utah speaker sold under the Radio Shack name.  In the middle is an Olsen 5\" speaker with 20 oz magnet.  I used this as a midrange speaker for a while, however its sensitivity was way too much compared to the rest of the components so I changed it out for a Radio Shack dome midrange speaker in 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1977.  The 8\" two way system has been modified once again (now has a new woofer). The woofer is a Radio Shack 8\" dual cone woofer.  Like the 12\" Triaxial woofer above, this was purchased at a Radio Shack  \"Where-is-As-is\" sale.  This speaker system is still in use today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1977.  The east wall of the bedroom, known as the \"concert wall\".  Most notable here is the addition of my newest speaker system, the \"Philips\".  This system used (naturally) a Philips 12\" woofer with 40 oz magnet and 2\" voice coil.  This new system was much more powerful than any of the previous systems I had built.  Above that is another 12\" system that was built over the summer (it used the Radio Shack [Utah] 12\" Triaxial speaker, however I disconnected the tweeter).  Also seen are several speaker cabinets that use the Radio Shack \"eight dollar woofer\".  The main problem with all of these speakers was the lack of sufficient power to drive them all (all I had at the time was about 50 watts per channel, and collectively all these speakers could have handled about 250 watts!).  Still, this array generated some fairly serious sound for a small bedroom!  Above and to the right of these speakers can be seen part of my Estes rocket collection. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view looking under the shelf to show some of the mass of wiring that made up the \"bugging system\".  Note the microphone that was used to make announcements throughout the house and property.   Also seen are dual cooling fans for the amp (not that the transistor amp got all that hot to begin with...).  Literature for Pioneer stereo gear graces the walls behind the equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view of the wiring mass under the shelf.  A patch panel can be seen to the right, this worked in a fashion similar to an old telephone switchboard.  Note the fuses and large power resistor under the top shelf.  This was used (incorrectly) at the time to help the amplifier drive 4 ohm speaker loads. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate 1977, a 40 channel Royce CB radio (and 12 VDC power supply) has been added to the system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA wider angle shot from late 1977/early 1978. To the left of the clock radio can be seen a box for the Audio Technica cartridge that was used on the Pioneer PL-112D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 1978.  The east wall of the room has been modified with another new speaker system.  Some of the previous ones have been dismantled.  A Tasco telescope can be seen at the far left of the photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1978.  A TEAC 2340 4 channel reel-to-reel recorder has been added.  This unit was my father's; he hardly ever used it so I took it over after obtaining a new solenoid for it.  This unit was a very luxurious item for a teen to have in the 1970's... new, these units went for around $1000 (a LOT of $$ back then)!  The sound quality of the unit was very, very good, it will easily compete with the sound from a CD player.  And, being a 4 track three head unit, it allowed for some fun editing and special effects.  The only problem with having this unit is that when I did get a cassette deck I was so disappointed in the decrease in sound quality!  People had talked about how great the modern cassette decks were... however, few (if any) could compete with a reel to reel machine of this caliber.  A Nakamichi (big $$$$) could probably come close, but it simply cannot match or exceed the quality of sound these reel to reel machines put out!  Also note the Pioneer fold out literature that is posted on the ceiling. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first FM antenna, March 1978.  This antenna started the \"DXing\" era for myself and several friends who also subsequently got FM antennas. Below the 5 element beam is an omni directional FM antenna. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1978.  A new (used) Heathkit AJ-15 FM tuner has been added, this was a vast improvement over the old Harmon Kardon tube (mono) tuner I was using previously.  I earned the $$ for this unit (bought it used from a high school classmate) by working for people in the neighborhood.  This tuner, coupled with the FM beam, allowed for many, many FM stations to be received, it was a major step up from the old Harmon Kardon unit.  Note the rotor for the antenna on the desk.  Also, a Radio Shack color organ is now mounted next the TEAC recorder.  Note the addition of the Radio Shack SA-10 amplifier (just above the Harmon Kardon tuner).  This amp was to replace the other Radio Shack amp I was using for the bugging system.  During the summer of 1977, a very violent thunderstorm hit the northeast US and knocked power out for all of New York city and much of the other southern New England states. This same storm took out the bugging system amp.  A voltage surge (from wires I had strung about 500 feet to the back of the property) blew the output stage of the amp.  I took the amp to Radio Shack but they wanted like $30 just to look at it (that is a LOT of $$ for a teen in 1977).  So, this amp was out of service for a while, however I long ago repaired it myself (after learning more about electronics).  It is in service to this day.  The system corner is very full now! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 1978.  A new Technics SU-7300 amp has been added, this helped the power shortage for all the speakers.  Also still in use is the old Harmon Kardon amp.  Total system power now was just under 100 watts per channel with all amps combined.  That does not sound like a lot of power by today's standards, but it was a significant amount to have as a kid in the 70's!  Also added are SWR and power meters for the CB as well as a new amp for the bugging system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1979.  This photo pretty much represents the peak of the development of my system in this bedroom.  Sitting at the \"controls\" here gave the feeling of being in the control room of a submarine the way that I was surrounded by electronics.  The setting was made especially cool with all the room lights off... the glow of many meters and indicators looked especially cool.  Many long hours were spent fooling with the gear in this setup.  I would stay up  until late hours, talking to people on the CB while simultaneously listening to music and watching TV.   People used to tell me \"you need to get out more\" until they saw this room... then they understood why I wanted to stay home and hang out!  I have many fond memories of the time I spent in this room.  Later in 1979 I moved to another new bedroom, and the system shown here was dismantled and moved. Although the system in the new bedroom was technically improved in terms of power, features and fidelity, it never had the same \"feel\" as the system in the corner of this room.  It was the beginning of the end of an era. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 1979.  A shot of a larger FM antenna used for DXing.  I eventually had two of these antennas on the roof.  We tried stacking them for even more gain, however this did not work out.  Nonetheless, one of these antennas did quite a good job at pulling in stations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of the system in the new room (late 1979).  Several new components have been added (a Kenwood KA-9100 amp, a TEAC A650 cassette deck, and a Nikko NT-850 tuner).  I got my first job in the summer of 1979 (and one with pretty good pay) and this allowed me to purchase the Kenwood, the Nikko and the Teac.  Not shown here, there are 12 \" woofers mounted in thin cabinets under the bed.  These were driven by one of the amplifiers with the bass cranked all the way up, the result was a floor that vibrated quite a bit (fortunately this room was on the ground level and no one lived in the basement below!).  With the Kenwood the total system power was up to 342 watts, this system ROCKED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1980.  A view of the south wall of the new room.  The most notable addition here is the light show and a new set of speakers (also homemade).  Total system power is now 342 watts.  Still modest by today's standards, but it was quite substantial for 1980. In 1995 I had a system with 2,200 watts of power... THAT system can shake a concrete floor!  Someday I'll add some photos of that gear (it includes 4 JBL 18\" subwoofers).\n\n\nSo....   That is the quick story of how I became involved in electronics!\n\n\nE-mail to Joe\nRoberts\nImages and HTML text \u00a9 Copyright 1998 by Jo\ne Roberts. Please  request permission to use photos for purposes other than \"personal use\".\n\n\n", "Introduction: This page shows some of the evolution of my stereo system and involvement with electronics as a teenager in the mid 1970s.  The earliest pictures I have are from 1976, however I started with stereo systems in the early 70s.  The photos below are in \nchronological order. \n\nWhy this page? At work and in related travels, I often get questioned as to how I got started in electronics. Basically I started playing with batteries and light bulbs at around age 7 (1967). From there things went somewhat slowly until around 1974 when I got into stereo systems.  Rather than tell the detailed story many times over, I put together this page to illustrate how things got started for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA shot of the corner of my bedroom with the stereo system from July 1976.  A Harmon Kardon (Trio) tube amp is at the center of the system (this unit was 12 watts per channel).  To the right of it is a Halicrafters short-wave radio.  Above that is a Harmon Kardon (Rondo) mono tube tuner.  The lower turntable is a modified GE phonograph.  I got this phonograph in 1972 (had an old Grundig console before that but it died).  When I got the Harmon Kardon amp, I had to find a way to wire the turntable to work with the amp (of course compact phono has no provisions for external connections).  This was my first major (for the time) accomplishment, taking the phono and rewiring the cartridge output so that I could plug it into the amp.  It worked!   The other turntable (above the green GE) was a second one I obtained at a later time.  The three items above the system are homemade \"star dials\", these were motorized planispheres that showed what stars were up at any given time.  Two speakers can be seen here, and 8\" two way and (below) a 12\" two way system.  The lower system is homebuilt. Note the Pioneer SX-636 literature on the wall behind the equipment!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA photo of my newly upgraded speaker system.  Previously it was a 12\" two way system with a horn tweeter originally built in the fall of 1974.  Now (October 1976) it has been upgraded to a three way system including a midrange and dome tweeter.  The speaker components (woofer and midrange) are Radio Shack brand, however Utah made these speakers for Radio Shack. This system is all homemade, basically made of 1 x 12 pine boards cut with a skillsaw (I did not have any fancy woodworking tools at the time).  This system is still in use today, it is fine for low power (up to 30 watts or so) listening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view of the system corner, this image is from late 1976.  A new woofer can be seen in the 8\" two way system. A fan has been installed under the shelf to keep the tube amp cool, it is powered by a train transformer mounted on the wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1977.  A new Pioneer PL-112D turntable has been added (it was my big Christmas present for 1976).  Had to re-arrange a number of items to accommodate the new gear.  With the new turntable, my 45 record collection suffered much less wear (even though I had modified the old GE phono to track a lot lighter).  It also sounds a lot better!  One old turntable is now retired. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view from early 1977.  Note the pile of 45 records on the desk.  Also, the 8\" speaker system has a light installed (for special effects).  The bulb was wired in series with the woofer, and it flashed in accordance with the volume of sound.  Problem was, it blew out too often! \n\n\nAre you a speaker builder/audio hobbyist in need of parts?\u00a0\nPlease check out Parts Express,  a great source for all kinds of RF connectors, speakers, components, etc.   I sure wish they were around when I was building speakers in the 70s, they have a HUGE offereing of components!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1977.  An old Revere reel to reel recorder (salvaged from the town dump by my father) is now mounted on the wall.  This unit was from 1957 and despite having no cabinet, worked quite well.  It was only mono, but at 7 1/2 ips the sound was actually pretty good.  I had this recorder up until around 1999 when I finally retired it permanently.  40+ years of service out of a piece of gear... most of the junk sold today would be lucky to last 1/3 that long.  Things were built to last back then, this recorder was very well made and heavy.  Also visible in this photo is a Realistic multitester.  This item was very helpful in doing various measurements!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 1976.  A new 12\" 3-way system made from speakers salvaged from the East Longmeadow MA town dump.  One person's trash is another persons treasure!  Speaker cabinet was made out of particle board and painted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1977.  A new Kenwood KA-3500 (40 watts/channel) amp has been added to the system as of 17 May 1977, a major upgrade from the old tube amp (both amps are still in service in 2008). I earned the money for this amp (price was $139.99 at Lechmere) by making a stone walkway.  It was a LOT of work, had to locate and haul many large flat rocks to the area and set them in the ground.  Probably moved about 5000 pounds of rocks to make this walkway, and it is still there today (as is the amp)!  Also, a new shelf has been added to hold equipment that had to be rearranged. Also note that a Realistic SA-100C amplifier has been added.  This amp was originally owned by my neighbor Paul Goewey, he later sold it to my brother and then I bought it after that.  This amp was used for the Bugging System.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 1977.   Another layer of shelving (basically pine boards) has been added to support the added equipment.  Power Meters for the speakers have been added as well.  Mounted on the front of the shelf (right below a small Radio Shack amplifier) are a number of switches... these controlled what was known as the \"bugging system\".  I had numerous (at peak about 12) speakers (which also functioned as microphones) wired all around the house and property.  Using this system, I could monitor what was going on at remote locations, or send music to those same locations.  This system was crude by today's standards, but overall it worked quite well considering what I had to work with.  Note the power control switchbox on the wall above the Pioneer PL-112D turntable.  This was used to control things like the fans that cool the amp, the bugging system, etc. Clock radios have also been rearranged somewhat due to the expanding system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1977 photo.  Some of the speakers that were installed in various speaker systems I made. At top left is a Philips 12\" woofer with 40 oz magnet and 2\" voice coil (a fine woofer for its day).  At top right is a Radio Shack 12\" triaxial speaker... actually, these were made by Utah and sold by Radio Shack under the Americana name. This speaker I got in summer of 1977 at a \"Where-is-As-is\" sale (does anyone remember those)?  Unfortunately, they only had the one speaker, so I got it, hoping to locate another (I never did, but today on Ebay that are not uncommon).  At the lower right is a 12\" Radio Shack speaker that we used to call the \"eight dollar woofer\".  It was a speaker with minimal capabilities, a 12\" speaker with a 1\" voice coil and a 5 Oz magnet, but it only cost $8!  It was a great entry level speaker for those who could afford little but who wanted a \"big\" speaker sound.  It was basically a Utah PA speaker.  Finally, at lower left is a Radio Shack 12\" musical instrument speaker.  This too was basically a Utah speaker sold under the Radio Shack name.  In the middle is an Olsen 5\" speaker with 20 oz magnet.  I used this as a midrange speaker for a while, however its sensitivity was way too much compared to the rest of the components so I changed it out for a Radio Shack dome midrange speaker in 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1977.  The 8\" two way system has been modified once again (now has a new woofer). The woofer is a Radio Shack 8\" dual cone woofer.  Like the 12\" Triaxial woofer above, this was purchased at a Radio Shack  \"Where-is-As-is\" sale.  This speaker system is still in use today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1977.  The east wall of the bedroom, known as the \"concert wall\".  Most notable here is the addition of my newest speaker system, the \"Philips\".  This system used (naturally) a Philips 12\" woofer with 40 oz magnet and 2\" voice coil.  This new system was much more powerful than any of the previous systems I had built.  Above that is another 12\" system that was built over the summer (it used the Radio Shack [Utah] 12\" Triaxial speaker, however I disconnected the tweeter).  Also seen are several speaker cabinets that use the Radio Shack \"eight dollar woofer\".  The main problem with all of these speakers was the lack of sufficient power to drive them all (all I had at the time was about 50 watts per channel, and collectively all these speakers could have handled about 250 watts!).  Still, this array generated some fairly serious sound for a small bedroom!  Above and to the right of these speakers can be seen part of my Estes rocket collection. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view looking under the shelf to show some of the mass of wiring that made up the \"bugging system\".  Note the microphone that was used to make announcements throughout the house and property.   Also seen are dual cooling fans for the amp (not that the transistor amp got all that hot to begin with...).  Literature for Pioneer stereo gear graces the walls behind the equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view of the wiring mass under the shelf.  A patch panel can be seen to the right, this worked in a fashion similar to an old telephone switchboard.  Note the fuses and large power resistor under the top shelf.  This was used (incorrectly) at the time to help the amplifier drive 4 ohm speaker loads. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate 1977, a 40 channel Royce CB radio (and 12 VDC power supply) has been added to the system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA wider angle shot from late 1977/early 1978. To the left of the clock radio can be seen a box for the Audio Technica cartridge that was used on the Pioneer PL-112D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 1978.  The east wall of the room has been modified with another new speaker system.  Some of the previous ones have been dismantled.  A Tasco telescope can be seen at the far left of the photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1978.  A TEAC 2340 4 channel reel-to-reel recorder has been added.  This unit was my father's; he hardly ever used it so I took it over after obtaining a new solenoid for it.  This unit was a very luxurious item for a teen to have in the 1970's... new, these units went for around $1000 (a LOT of $$ back then)!  The sound quality of the unit was very, very good, it will easily compete with the sound from a CD player.  And, being a 4 track three head unit, it allowed for some fun editing and special effects.  The only problem with having this unit is that when I did get a cassette deck I was so disappointed in the decrease in sound quality!  People had talked about how great the modern cassette decks were... however, few (if any) could compete with a reel to reel machine of this caliber.  A Nakamichi (big $$$$) could probably come close, but it simply cannot match or exceed the quality of sound these reel to reel machines put out!  Also note the Pioneer fold out literature that is posted on the ceiling. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first FM antenna, March 1978.  This antenna started the \"DXing\" era for myself and several friends who also subsequently got FM antennas. Below the 5 element beam is an omni directional FM antenna. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1978.  A new (used) Heathkit AJ-15 FM tuner has been added, this was a vast improvement over the old Harmon Kardon tube (mono) tuner I was using previously.  I earned the $$ for this unit (bought it used from a high school classmate) by working for people in the neighborhood.  This tuner, coupled with the FM beam, allowed for many, many FM stations to be received, it was a major step up from the old Harmon Kardon unit.  Note the rotor for the antenna on the desk.  Also, a Radio Shack color organ is now mounted next the TEAC recorder.  Note the addition of the Radio Shack SA-10 amplifier (just above the Harmon Kardon tuner).  This amp was to replace the other Radio Shack amp I was using for the bugging system.  During the summer of 1977, a very violent thunderstorm hit the northeast US and knocked power out for all of New York city and much of the other southern New England states. This same storm took out the bugging system amp.  A voltage surge (from wires I had strung about 500 feet to the back of the property) blew the output stage of the amp.  I took the amp to Radio Shack but they wanted like $30 just to look at it (that is a LOT of $$ for a teen in 1977).  So, this amp was out of service for a while, however I long ago repaired it myself (after learning more about electronics).  It is in service to this day.  The system corner is very full now! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 1978.  A new Technics SU-7300 amp has been added, this helped the power shortage for all the speakers.  Also still in use is the old Harmon Kardon amp.  Total system power now was just under 100 watts per channel with all amps combined.  That does not sound like a lot of power by today's standards, but it was a significant amount to have as a kid in the 70's!  Also added are SWR and power meters for the CB as well as a new amp for the bugging system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1979.  This photo pretty much represents the peak of the development of my system in this bedroom.  Sitting at the \"controls\" here gave the feeling of being in the control room of a submarine the way that I was surrounded by electronics.  The setting was made especially cool with all the room lights off... the glow of many meters and indicators looked especially cool.  Many long hours were spent fooling with the gear in this setup.  I would stay up  until late hours, talking to people on the CB while simultaneously listening to music and watching TV.   People used to tell me \"you need to get out more\" until they saw this room... then they understood why I wanted to stay home and hang out!  I have many fond memories of the time I spent in this room.  Later in 1979 I moved to another new bedroom, and the system shown here was dismantled and moved. Although the system in the new bedroom was technically improved in terms of power, features and fidelity, it never had the same \"feel\" as the system in the corner of this room.  It was the beginning of the end of an era. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 1979.  A shot of a larger FM antenna used for DXing.  I eventually had two of these antennas on the roof.  We tried stacking them for even more gain, however this did not work out.  Nonetheless, one of these antennas did quite a good job at pulling in stations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of the system in the new room (late 1979).  Several new components have been added (a Kenwood KA-9100 amp, a TEAC A650 cassette deck, and a Nikko NT-850 tuner).  I got my first job in the summer of 1979 (and one with pretty good pay) and this allowed me to purchase the Kenwood, the Nikko and the Teac.  Not shown here, there are 12 \" woofers mounted in thin cabinets under the bed.  These were driven by one of the amplifiers with the bass cranked all the way up, the result was a floor that vibrated quite a bit (fortunately this room was on the ground level and no one lived in the basement below!).  With the Kenwood the total system power was up to 342 watts, this system ROCKED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1980.  A view of the south wall of the new room.  The most notable addition here is the light show and a new set of speakers (also homemade).  Total system power is now 342 watts.  Still modest by today's standards, but it was quite substantial for 1980. In 1995 I had a system with 2,200 watts of power... THAT system can shake a concrete floor!  Someday I'll add some photos of that gear (it includes 4 JBL 18\" subwoofers).\n\n\nSo....

A new (used) Heathkit AJ-15 FM tuner has been added, this was a vast improvement over the old Harmon Kardon tube (mono) tuner I was using previously.  I earned the $$ for this unit (bought it used from a high school classmate) by working for people in the neighborhood.  This tuner, coupled with the FM beam, allowed for many, many FM stations to be received, it was a major step up from the old Harmon Kardon unit.  Note the rotor for the antenna on the desk.  Also, a Radio Shack color organ is now mounted next the TEAC recorder.  Note the addition of the Radio Shack SA-10 amplifier (just above the Harmon Kardon tuner).  This amp was to replace the other Radio Shack amp I was using for the bugging system.  During the summer of 1977, a very violent thunderstorm hit the northeast US and knocked power out for all of New York city and much of the other southern New England states. This same storm took out the bugging system amp.  A voltage surge (from wires I had strung about 500 feet to the back of the property) blew the output stage of the amp.  I took the amp to Radio Shack but they wanted like $30 just to look at it (that is a LOT of $$ for a teen in 1977).  So, this amp was out of service for a while, however I long ago repaired it myself (after learning more about electronics).  It is in service to this day.  The system corner is very full now! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 1978.  A new Technics SU-7300 amp has been added, this helped the power shortage for all the speakers.  Also still in use is the old Harmon Kardon amp.  Total system power now was just under 100 watts per channel with all amps combined.  That does not sound like a lot of power by today's standards, but it was a significant amount to have as a kid in the 70's!  Also added are SWR and power meters for the CB as well as a new amp for the bugging system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1979.  This photo pretty much represents the peak of the development of my system in this bedroom.  Sitting at the \"controls\" here gave the feeling of being in the control room of a submarine the way that I was surrounded by electronics.  The setting was made especially cool with all the room lights off... the glow of many meters and indicators looked especially cool.  Many long hours were spent fooling with the gear in this setup.  I would stay up  until late hours, talking to people on the CB while simultaneously listening to music and watching TV.   People used to tell me \"you need to get out more\" until they saw this room... then they understood why I wanted to stay home and hang out!  I have many fond memories of the time I spent in this room.  Later in 1979 I moved to another new bedroom, and the system shown here was dismantled and moved. Although the system in the new bedroom was technically improved in terms of power, features and fidelity, it never had the same \"feel\" as the system in the corner of this room.  It was the beginning of the end of an era. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 1979.  A shot of a larger FM antenna used for DXing.  I eventually had two of these antennas on the roof.  We tried stacking them for even more gain, however this did not work out.  Nonetheless, one of these antennas did quite a good job at pulling in stations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of the system in the new room (late 1979).  Several new components have been added (a Kenwood KA-9100 amp, a TEAC A650 cassette deck, and a Nikko NT-850 tuner).  I got my first job in the summer of 1979 (and one with pretty good pay) and this allowed me to purchase the Kenwood, the Nikko and the Teac.  Not shown here, there are 12 \" woofers mounted in thin cabinets under the bed.  These were driven by one of the amplifiers with the bass cranked all the way up, the result was a floor that vibrated quite a bit (fortunately this room was on the ground level and no one lived in the basement below!).  With the Kenwood the total system power was up to 342 watts, this system ROCKED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1980.  A view of the south wall of the new room.  The most notable addition here is the light show and a new set of speakers (also homemade).  Total system power is now 342 watts.  Still modest by today's standards, but it was quite substantial for 1980. In 1995 I had a system with 2,200 watts of power... THAT system can shake a concrete floor!  Someday I'll add some photos of that gear (it includes 4 JBL 18\" subwoofers).\n\n\nSo....   That is the quick story of how I became involved in electronics!\n\n\nE-mail to Joe\nRoberts\nImages and HTML text \u00a9 Copyright 1998 by Jo\ne Roberts. Please  request permission to use photos for purposes other than \"personal use\".\n\n\n", "Why this page? At work and in related travels, I often get questioned as to how I got started in electronics. Basically I started playing with batteries and light bulbs at around age 7 (1967). From there things went somewhat slowly until around 1974 when I got into stereo systems.  Rather than tell the detailed story many times over, I put together this page to illustrate how things got started for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA shot of the corner of my bedroom with the stereo system from July 1976.  A Harmon Kardon (Trio) tube amp is at the center of the system (this unit was 12 watts per channel).  To the right of it is a Halicrafters short-wave radio.  Above that is a Harmon Kardon (Rondo) mono tube tuner.  The lower turntable is a modified GE phonograph.  I got this phonograph in 1972 (had an old Grundig console before that but it died).  When I got the Harmon Kardon amp, I had to find a way to wire the turntable to work with the amp (of course compact phono has no provisions for external connections).  This was my first major (for the time) accomplishment, taking the phono and rewiring the cartridge output so that I could plug it into the amp.  It worked!   The other turntable (above the green GE) was a second one I obtained at a later time.  The three items above the system are homemade \"star dials\", these were motorized planispheres that showed what stars were up at any given time.  Two speakers can be seen here, and 8\" two way and (below) a 12\" two way system.  The lower system is homebuilt. Note the Pioneer SX-636 literature on the wall behind the equipment!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA photo of my newly upgraded speaker system.  Previously it was a 12\" two way system with a horn tweeter originally built in the fall of 1974.  Now (October 1976) it has been upgraded to a three way system including a midrange and dome tweeter.  The speaker components (woofer and midrange) are Radio Shack brand, however Utah made these speakers for Radio Shack. This system is all homemade, basically made of 1 x 12 pine boards cut with a skillsaw (I did not have any fancy woodworking tools at the time).  This system is still in use today, it is fine for low power (up to 30 watts or so) listening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view of the system corner, this image is from late 1976.  A new woofer can be seen in the 8\" two way system. A fan has been installed under the shelf to keep the tube amp cool, it is powered by a train transformer mounted on the wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1977.  A new Pioneer PL-112D turntable has been added (it was my big Christmas present for 1976).  Had to re-arrange a number of items to accommodate the new gear.  With the new turntable, my 45 record collection suffered much less wear (even though I had modified the old GE phono to track a lot lighter).  It also sounds a lot better!  One old turntable is now retired. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view from early 1977.  Note the pile of 45 records on the desk.  Also, the 8\" speaker system has a light installed (for special effects).  The bulb was wired in series with the woofer, and it flashed in accordance with the volume of sound.  Problem was, it blew out too often! \n\n\nAre you a speaker builder/audio hobbyist in need of parts?\u00a0\nPlease check out Parts Express,  a great source for all kinds of RF connectors, speakers, components, etc.   I sure wish they were around when I was building speakers in the 70s, they have a HUGE offereing of components!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1977.  An old Revere reel to reel recorder (salvaged from the town dump by my father) is now mounted on the wall.  This unit was from 1957 and despite having no cabinet, worked quite well.  It was only mono, but at 7 1/2 ips the sound was actually pretty good.  I had this recorder up until around 1999 when I finally retired it permanently.  40+ years of service out of a piece of gear... most of the junk sold today would be lucky to last 1/3 that long.  Things were built to last back then, this recorder was very well made and heavy.  Also visible in this photo is a Realistic multitester.  This item was very helpful in doing various measurements!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 1976.  A new 12\" 3-way system made from speakers salvaged from the East Longmeadow MA town dump.  One person's trash is another persons treasure!  Speaker cabinet was made out of particle board and painted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1977.  A new Kenwood KA-3500 (40 watts/channel) amp has been added to the system as of 17 May 1977, a major upgrade from the old tube amp (both amps are still in service in 2008). I earned the money for this amp (price was $139.99 at Lechmere) by making a stone walkway.  It was a LOT of work, had to locate and haul many large flat rocks to the area and set them in the ground.  Probably moved about 5000 pounds of rocks to make this walkway, and it is still there today (as is the amp)!  Also, a new shelf has been added to hold equipment that had to be rearranged. Also note that a Realistic SA-100C amplifier has been added.  This amp was originally owned by my neighbor Paul Goewey, he later sold it to my brother and then I bought it after that.  This amp was used for the Bugging System.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 1977.   Another layer of shelving (basically pine boards) has been added to support the added equipment.  Power Meters for the speakers have been added as well.  Mounted on the front of the shelf (right below a small Radio Shack amplifier) are a number of switches... these controlled what was known as the \"bugging system\".  I had numerous (at peak about 12) speakers (which also functioned as microphones) wired all around the house and property.  Using this system, I could monitor what was going on at remote locations, or send music to those same locations.  This system was crude by today's standards, but overall it worked quite well considering what I had to work with.  Note the power control switchbox on the wall above the Pioneer PL-112D turntable.  This was used to control things like the fans that cool the amp, the bugging system, etc. Clock radios have also been rearranged somewhat due to the expanding system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1977 photo.  Some of the speakers that were installed in various speaker systems I made. At top left is a Philips 12\" woofer with 40 oz magnet and 2\" voice coil (a fine woofer for its day).  At top right is a Radio Shack 12\" triaxial speaker... actually, these were made by Utah and sold by Radio Shack under the Americana name. This speaker I got in summer of 1977 at a \"Where-is-As-is\" sale (does anyone remember those)?  Unfortunately, they only had the one speaker, so I got it, hoping to locate another (I never did, but today on Ebay that are not uncommon).  At the lower right is a 12\" Radio Shack speaker that we used to call the \"eight dollar woofer\".  It was a speaker with minimal capabilities, a 12\" speaker with a 1\" voice coil and a 5 Oz magnet, but it only cost $8!  It was a great entry level speaker for those who could afford little but who wanted a \"big\" speaker sound.  It was basically a Utah PA speaker.  Finally, at lower left is a Radio Shack 12\" musical instrument speaker.  This too was basically a Utah speaker sold under the Radio Shack name.  In the middle is an Olsen 5\" speaker with 20 oz magnet.  I used this as a midrange speaker for a while, however its sensitivity was way too much compared to the rest of the components so I changed it out for a Radio Shack dome midrange speaker in 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1977.  The 8\" two way system has been modified once again (now has a new woofer). The woofer is a Radio Shack 8\" dual cone woofer.  Like the 12\" Triaxial woofer above, this was purchased at a Radio Shack  \"Where-is-As-is\" sale.  This speaker system is still in use today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1977.  The east wall of the bedroom, known as the \"concert wall\".  Most notable here is the addition of my newest speaker system, the \"Philips\".  This system used (naturally) a Philips 12\" woofer with 40 oz magnet and 2\" voice coil.  This new system was much more powerful than any of the previous systems I had built.  Above that is another 12\" system that was built over the summer (it used the Radio Shack [Utah] 12\" Triaxial speaker, however I disconnected the tweeter).  Also seen are several speaker cabinets that use the Radio Shack \"eight dollar woofer\".  The main problem with all of these speakers was the lack of sufficient power to drive them all (all I had at the time was about 50 watts per channel, and collectively all these speakers could have handled about 250 watts!).  Still, this array generated some fairly serious sound for a small bedroom!  Above and to the right of these speakers can be seen part of my Estes rocket collection. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view looking under the shelf to show some of the mass of wiring that made up the \"bugging system\".  Note the microphone that was used to make announcements throughout the house and property.   Also seen are dual cooling fans for the amp (not that the transistor amp got all that hot to begin with...).  Literature for Pioneer stereo gear graces the walls behind the equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view of the wiring mass under the shelf.  A patch panel can be seen to the right, this worked in a fashion similar to an old telephone switchboard.  Note the fuses and large power resistor under the top shelf.  This was used (incorrectly) at the time to help the amplifier drive 4 ohm speaker loads. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate 1977, a 40 channel Royce CB radio (and 12 VDC power supply) has been added to the system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA wider angle shot from late 1977/early 1978. To the left of the clock radio can be seen a box for the Audio Technica cartridge that was used on the Pioneer PL-112D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 1978.  The east wall of the room has been modified with another new speaker system.  Some of the previous ones have been dismantled.  A Tasco telescope can be seen at the far left of the photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1978.  A TEAC 2340 4 channel reel-to-reel recorder has been added.  This unit was my father's; he hardly ever used it so I took it over after obtaining a new solenoid for it.  This unit was a very luxurious item for a teen to have in the 1970's... new, these units went for around $1000 (a LOT of $$ back then)!  The sound quality of the unit was very, very good, it will easily compete with the sound from a CD player.  And, being a 4 track three head unit, it allowed for some fun editing and special effects.  The only problem with having this unit is that when I did get a cassette deck I was so disappointed in the decrease in sound quality!  People had talked about how great the modern cassette decks were... however, few (if any) could compete with a reel to reel machine of this caliber.  A Nakamichi (big $$$$) could probably come close, but it simply cannot match or exceed the quality of sound these reel to reel machines put out!  Also note the Pioneer fold out literature that is posted on the ceiling. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first FM antenna, March 1978.  This antenna started the \"DXing\" era for myself and several friends who also subsequently got FM antennas. Below the 5 element beam is an omni directional FM antenna. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1978.  A new (used) Heathkit AJ-15 FM tuner has been added, this was a vast improvement over the old Harmon Kardon tube (mono) tuner I was using previously.

Also seen are several speaker cabinets that use the Radio Shack \"eight dollar woofer\".  The main problem with all of these speakers was the lack of sufficient power to drive them all (all I had at the time was about 50 watts per channel, and collectively all these speakers could have handled about 250 watts!).  Still, this array generated some fairly serious sound for a small bedroom!  Above and to the right of these speakers can be seen part of my Estes rocket collection. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view looking under the shelf to show some of the mass of wiring that made up the \"bugging system\".  Note the microphone that was used to make announcements throughout the house and property.   Also seen are dual cooling fans for the amp (not that the transistor amp got all that hot to begin with...).  Literature for Pioneer stereo gear graces the walls behind the equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view of the wiring mass under the shelf.  A patch panel can be seen to the right, this worked in a fashion similar to an old telephone switchboard.  Note the fuses and large power resistor under the top shelf.  This was used (incorrectly) at the time to help the amplifier drive 4 ohm speaker loads. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate 1977, a 40 channel Royce CB radio (and 12 VDC power supply) has been added to the system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA wider angle shot from late 1977/early 1978. To the left of the clock radio can be seen a box for the Audio Technica cartridge that was used on the Pioneer PL-112D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 1978.  The east wall of the room has been modified with another new speaker system.  Some of the previous ones have been dismantled.  A Tasco telescope can be seen at the far left of the photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1978.  A TEAC 2340 4 channel reel-to-reel recorder has been added.  This unit was my father's; he hardly ever used it so I took it over after obtaining a new solenoid for it.  This unit was a very luxurious item for a teen to have in the 1970's... new, these units went for around $1000 (a LOT of $$ back then)!  The sound quality of the unit was very, very good, it will easily compete with the sound from a CD player.  And, being a 4 track three head unit, it allowed for some fun editing and special effects.  The only problem with having this unit is that when I did get a cassette deck I was so disappointed in the decrease in sound quality!  People had talked about how great the modern cassette decks were... however, few (if any) could compete with a reel to reel machine of this caliber.  A Nakamichi (big $$$$) could probably come close, but it simply cannot match or exceed the quality of sound these reel to reel machines put out!  Also note the Pioneer fold out literature that is posted on the ceiling. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first FM antenna, March 1978.  This antenna started the \"DXing\" era for myself and several friends who also subsequently got FM antennas. Below the 5 element beam is an omni directional FM antenna. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1978.  A new (used) Heathkit AJ-15 FM tuner has been added, this was a vast improvement over the old Harmon Kardon tube (mono) tuner I was using previously.  I earned the $$ for this unit (bought it used from a high school classmate) by working for people in the neighborhood.  This tuner, coupled with the FM beam, allowed for many, many FM stations to be received, it was a major step up from the old Harmon Kardon unit.  Note the rotor for the antenna on the desk.  Also, a Radio Shack color organ is now mounted next the TEAC recorder.  Note the addition of the Radio Shack SA-10 amplifier (just above the Harmon Kardon tuner).  This amp was to replace the other Radio Shack amp I was using for the bugging system.  During the summer of 1977, a very violent thunderstorm hit the northeast US and knocked power out for all of New York city and much of the other southern New England states. This same storm took out the bugging system amp.  A voltage surge (from wires I had strung about 500 feet to the back of the property) blew the output stage of the amp.  I took the amp to Radio Shack but they wanted like $30 just to look at it (that is a LOT of $$ for a teen in 1977).  So, this amp was out of service for a while, however I long ago repaired it myself (after learning more about electronics).  It is in service to this day.  The system corner is very full now! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 1978.  A new Technics SU-7300 amp has been added, this helped the power shortage for all the speakers.  Also still in use is the old Harmon Kardon amp.  Total system power now was just under 100 watts per channel with all amps combined.  That does not sound like a lot of power by today's standards, but it was a significant amount to have as a kid in the 70's!  Also added are SWR and power meters for the CB as well as a new amp for the bugging system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1979.  This photo pretty much represents the peak of the development of my system in this bedroom.  Sitting at the \"controls\" here gave the feeling of being in the control room of a submarine the way that I was surrounded by electronics.  The setting was made especially cool with all the room lights off... the glow of many meters and indicators looked especially cool.  Many long hours were spent fooling with the gear in this setup.  I would stay up  until late hours, talking to people on the CB while simultaneously listening to music and watching TV.   People used to tell me \"you need to get out more\" until they saw this room... then they understood why I wanted to stay home and hang out!  I have many fond memories of the time I spent in this room.  Later in 1979 I moved to another new bedroom, and the system shown here was dismantled and moved. Although the system in the new bedroom was technically improved in terms of power, features and fidelity, it never had the same \"feel\" as the system in the corner of this room.  It was the beginning of the end of an era. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 1979.  A shot of a larger FM antenna used for DXing.  I eventually had two of these antennas on the roof.  We tried stacking them for even more gain, however this did not work out.  Nonetheless, one of these antennas did quite a good job at pulling in stations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of the system in the new room (late 1979).  Several new components have been added (a Kenwood KA-9100 amp, a TEAC A650 cassette deck, and a Nikko NT-850 tuner).  I got my first job in the summer of 1979 (and one with pretty good pay) and this allowed me to purchase the Kenwood, the Nikko and the Teac.  Not shown here, there are 12 \" woofers mounted in thin cabinets under the bed.  These were driven by one of the amplifiers with the bass cranked all the way up, the result was a floor that vibrated quite a bit (fortunately this room was on the ground level and no one lived in the basement below!).  With the Kenwood the total system power was up to 342 watts, this system ROCKED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1980.  A view of the south wall of the new room.  The most notable addition here is the light show and a new set of speakers (also homemade).  Total system power is now 342 watts.  Still modest by today's standards, but it was quite substantial for 1980. In 1995 I had a system with 2,200 watts of power... THAT system can shake a concrete floor!  Someday I'll add some photos of that gear (it includes 4 JBL 18\" subwoofers).\n\n\nSo....   That is the quick story of how I became involved in electronics!\n\n\nE-mail to Joe\nRoberts\nImages and HTML text \u00a9 Copyright 1998 by Jo\ne Roberts. Please  request permission to use photos for purposes other than \"personal use\".\n\n\n", "\nA shot of the corner of my bedroom with the stereo system from July 1976.  A Harmon Kardon (Trio) tube amp is at the center of the system (this unit was 12 watts per channel).  To the right of it is a Halicrafters short-wave radio.  Above that is a Harmon Kardon (Rondo) mono tube tuner.  The lower turntable is a modified GE phonograph.  I got this phonograph in 1972 (had an old Grundig console before that but it died).  When I got the Harmon Kardon amp, I had to find a way to wire the turntable to work with the amp (of course compact phono has no provisions for external connections).  This was my first major (for the time) accomplishment, taking the phono and rewiring the cartridge output so that I could plug it into the amp.  It worked!   The other turntable (above the green GE) was a second one I obtained at a later time.  The three items above the system are homemade \"star dials\", these were motorized planispheres that showed what stars were up at any given time.  Two speakers can be seen here, and 8\" two way and (below) a 12\" two way system.  The lower system is homebuilt. Note the Pioneer SX-636 literature on the wall behind the equipment!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA photo of my newly upgraded speaker system.  Previously it was a 12\" two way system with a horn tweeter originally built in the fall of 1974.  Now (October 1976) it has been upgraded to a three way system including a midrange and dome tweeter.  The speaker components (woofer and midrange) are Radio Shack brand, however Utah made these speakers for Radio Shack. This system is all homemade, basically made of 1 x 12 pine boards cut with a skillsaw (I did not have any fancy woodworking tools at the time).  This system is still in use today, it is fine for low power (up to 30 watts or so) listening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view of the system corner, this image is from late 1976.  A new woofer can be seen in the 8\" two way system. A fan has been installed under the shelf to keep the tube amp cool, it is powered by a train transformer mounted on the wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1977.  A new Pioneer PL-112D turntable has been added (it was my big Christmas present for 1976).  Had to re-arrange a number of items to accommodate the new gear.  With the new turntable, my 45 record collection suffered much less wear (even though I had modified the old GE phono to track a lot lighter).  It also sounds a lot better!  One old turntable is now retired. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view from early 1977.  Note the pile of 45 records on the desk.  Also, the 8\" speaker system has a light installed (for special effects).  The bulb was wired in series with the woofer, and it flashed in accordance with the volume of sound.  Problem was, it blew out too often! \n\n\nAre you a speaker builder/audio hobbyist in need of parts?\u00a0\nPlease check out Parts Express,  a great source for all kinds of RF connectors, speakers, components, etc.   I sure wish they were around when I was building speakers in the 70s, they have a HUGE offereing of components!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1977.  An old Revere reel to reel recorder (salvaged from the town dump by my father) is now mounted on the wall.  This unit was from 1957 and despite having no cabinet, worked quite well.  It was only mono, but at 7 1/2 ips the sound was actually pretty good.  I had this recorder up until around 1999 when I finally retired it permanently.  40+ years of service out of a piece of gear... most of the junk sold today would be lucky to last 1/3 that long.  Things were built to last back then, this recorder was very well made and heavy.  Also visible in this photo is a Realistic multitester.  This item was very helpful in doing various measurements!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 1976.  A new 12\" 3-way system made from speakers salvaged from the East Longmeadow MA town dump.  One person's trash is another persons treasure!  Speaker cabinet was made out of particle board and painted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 1977.  A new Kenwood KA-3500 (40 watts/channel) amp has been added to the system as of 17 May 1977, a major upgrade from the old tube amp (both amps are still in service in 2008). I earned the money for this amp (price was $139.99 at Lechmere) by making a stone walkway.  It was a LOT of work, had to locate and haul many large flat rocks to the area and set them in the ground.  Probably moved about 5000 pounds of rocks to make this walkway, and it is still there today (as is the amp)!  Also, a new shelf has been added to hold equipment that had to be rearranged. Also note that a Realistic SA-100C amplifier has been added.  This amp was originally owned by my neighbor Paul Goewey, he later sold it to my brother and then I bought it after that.  This amp was used for the Bugging System.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 1977.   Another layer of shelving (basically pine boards) has been added to support the added equipment.  Power Meters for the speakers have been added as well.  Mounted on the front of the shelf (right below a small Radio Shack amplifier) are a number of switches... these controlled what was known as the \"bugging system\".  I had numerous (at peak about 12) speakers (which also functioned as microphones) wired all around the house and property.  Using this system, I could monitor what was going on at remote locations, or send music to those same locations.  This system was crude by today's standards, but overall it worked quite well considering what I had to work with.  Note the power control switchbox on the wall above the Pioneer PL-112D turntable.  This was used to control things like the fans that cool the amp, the bugging system, etc. Clock radios have also been rearranged somewhat due to the expanding system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1977 photo.  Some of the speakers that were installed in various speaker systems I made. At top left is a Philips 12\" woofer with 40 oz magnet and 2\" voice coil (a fine woofer for its day).  At top right is a Radio Shack 12\" triaxial speaker... actually, these were made by Utah and sold by Radio Shack under the Americana name. This speaker I got in summer of 1977 at a \"Where-is-As-is\" sale (does anyone remember those)?  Unfortunately, they only had the one speaker, so I got it, hoping to locate another (I never did, but today on Ebay that are not uncommon).  At the lower right is a 12\" Radio Shack speaker that we used to call the \"eight dollar woofer\".  It was a speaker with minimal capabilities, a 12\" speaker with a 1\" voice coil and a 5 Oz magnet, but it only cost $8!  It was a great entry level speaker for those who could afford little but who wanted a \"big\" speaker sound.  It was basically a Utah PA speaker.  Finally, at lower left is a Radio Shack 12\" musical instrument speaker.  This too was basically a Utah speaker sold under the Radio Shack name.  In the middle is an Olsen 5\" speaker with 20 oz magnet.  I used this as a midrange speaker for a while, however its sensitivity was way too much compared to the rest of the components so I changed it out for a Radio Shack dome midrange speaker in 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1977.  The 8\" two way system has been modified once again (now has a new woofer). The woofer is a Radio Shack 8\" dual cone woofer.  Like the 12\" Triaxial woofer above, this was purchased at a Radio Shack  \"Where-is-As-is\" sale.  This speaker system is still in use today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1977.  The east wall of the bedroom, known as the \"concert wall\".  Most notable here is the addition of my newest speaker system, the \"Philips\".  This system used (naturally) a Philips 12\" woofer with 40 oz magnet and 2\" voice coil.  This new system was much more powerful than any of the previous systems I had built.  Above that is another 12\" system that was built over the summer (it used the Radio Shack [Utah] 12\" Triaxial speaker, however I disconnected the tweeter).

Note the microphone that was used to make announcements throughout the house and property.   Also seen are dual cooling fans for the amp (not that the transistor amp got all that hot to begin with...).  Literature for Pioneer stereo gear graces the walls behind the equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother view of the wiring mass under the shelf.  A patch panel can be seen to the right, this worked in a fashion similar to an old telephone switchboard.  Note the fuses and large power resistor under the top shelf.  This was used (incorrectly) at the time to help the amplifier drive 4 ohm speaker loads. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate 1977, a 40 channel Royce CB radio (and 12 VDC power supply) has been added to the system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA wider angle shot from late 1977/early 1978. To the left of the clock radio can be seen a box for the Audio Technica cartridge that was used on the Pioneer PL-112D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 1978.  The east wall of the room has been modified with another new speaker system.  Some of the previous ones have been dismantled.  A Tasco telescope can be seen at the far left of the photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1978.  A TEAC 2340 4 channel reel-to-reel recorder has been added.

And some respectable scholars and industry figures have questioned whether psychographic targeting does much at all. But to put it simply, advertising would not be a hugely profitable industry if it were total hokum, and Facebook made just shy of $40 billion last year in digital advertising largely on the strength of connecting advertisers directly with their audiences, all thanks to an increasingly granular set of microtargeting tools. While Facebook has since restricted some of the tools it offers to advertisers, the company still allows for extensive targeting options.

These rollers typically each have an axis of rotation at 45\u00b0 to the plane of the wheel and at 45\u00b0 to a line through the centre of the roller parallel to the axis of rotation of the wheel.[3] A typical configuration is the four-wheeled one of the URANUS omni-directional mobile robot[4] (pictured) or a wheel chair with Mecanum wheels[5] (similar to that pictured). By alternating wheels with left and right-handed rollers, in such a way that each wheel applies force roughly at right angles to the wheelbase diagonal the wheel is on, the vehicle is stable and can be made to move in any direction and turn by varying the speed and direction of rotation of each wheel. Moving all four wheels in the same direction causes forward or backward movement, running the wheels on one side in the opposite direction to those on the other side causes rotation of the vehicle, and running the wheels on one diagonal in the opposite direction to those on the other diagonal causes sideways movement. Combinations of these wheel motions allow for vehicle motion in any direction with any vehicle rotation (including no rotation at all).", "The US Navy bought the patent from Ilon and put researchers to work on it in the 1980s in Panama City. The US Navy has used it for transporting items around ships. In 1997, Airtrax Incorporated and several other companies each paid the US Navy $2,500 for rights to the technology, including old drawings of how the motors and controllers worked, to build an omnidirectional forklift truck that could maneuver in tight spaces such as the deck of an aircraft carrier. These vehicles are now in production.", "Tracked vehicles and skid steer vehicles utilize similar methods for turning. However, these vehicles typically drag across the ground while turning and may do considerable damage to a soft or fragile surface. The high friction against the ground while turning also requires high-torque engines to overcome the friction. By comparison, the design of the Mecanum wheel allows for in-place rotation with minimal ground friction and low torque."], "title": "Mecanum wheel", "by": "curtis", "score": 165, "time": 1525400586, "top_comment": {"kids": [16997277], "parent": 16991756, "text": "Intralox belts are sold under all sorts of names...mecnasort and tabletronix were a few older ones I recall when I first started as an industrial machinist 15 years ago.

Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are governed by a limited set of rules which remain simple and unobtrusive. Conforming to them is a pleasure. Because Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido are inherently introspective disciplines, they also invite you to transgress the rules in order to find your own. Breaking the rules is fun. Finally, if Lisp, Jazz, and Aikido unify so many paradigms, styles, or techniques, it is not by mere accumulation but because they live at the meta-level and let you reinvent them. Working at the meta-level is an enlightening experience. Understand your aesthetic sensitivities and you may gain considerable insight on your own psychology of programming.

I totally agree with the author here. I was surprised not to see any mention of cloud facing open source products. Kubernetes seems like a prime example. Google lost its containerization first mover advantage to Docker (remember google was famous early for its internal use of containers). So they targeted the next level up the stack of container orchestration. Kubernetes is a great project, but its clear priority is compatibility with the cloud computing business model. It didn\u2019t take long for google to offer GKE on top of kubernetes. At least for now, there is feature parity between open source and hosted versions. But I don\u2019t expect that to last long. I would be wary of the kubernetes project introducing features that only work well in google\u2019s cloud.<p>The main externality of this open source EEE strategy is developer opportunity cost. When google swept into the chat market, they used their size and first mover advantage to push an open standard, XMPP. So developers who might have worked on other projects&#x2F;standards naturally gravitated toward XMPP and contributed their time there.

Japan had pretty much reached a steady state by the time Tokugawa Iyeyasu came to power in 1600; most of the available land had been cultivated or settled, and, especially after the policies of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, society was locked in a rigid structure without much room for advancement or unrest.<p>As a result, the samurai class, especially Tokugawa&#x27;s bannermen and &quot;inner&quot; families, sort of lost their purpose. There were no more wars to fight - not when peace lasted &quot;as long as the waves roll&quot; - and the strongest rebels they could expect were peasants who could not own swords.<p>Because they couldn&#x27;t just revoke the lands Iyeyasu had distributed (without very good reason), and to give the samurai <i>something</i> to do, the Edo government expanded constantly, creating dozens of superfluous or sinecure bureaucratic roles, so that the second and third sons of samurai families wouldn&#x27;t just sit around at home. I believe this pattern was repeated across the various daimyo han at each castle town. Further, the samurai household <i>themselves</i> created redundant job openings just to get more peasants out of unemployment. This was how every samurai ended up with six porters. Even as certain samurai families sunk into abject poverty in the 1800s, as the shogunate neared its end, this policy continued: your grandfather had increased the number of household retainers from five to six, to give someone&#x27;s fourth son a job; and it had become hereditary, and now that fourth son&#x27;s grandson was <i>your</i> sixth retainer, and you couldn&#x27;t destroy the position even if you could barely afford to pay him.<p>When I hear politicians talking about &quot;creating jobs&quot;, I think of the shogunate.", "by": "lainga", "time": 1525449681, "type": "comment", "id": 16995608}, "type": "story", "id": 16995389}, "568": {"kids": [16995970, 16997014, 16996136, 16996002, 16996367, 16996069, 16996228, 16997039, 16996106, 16996862, 17002631, 16997212, 16996180, 16995974, 16997292, 17004245, 17001065, 16996660, 17001802, 16999771, 16996783, 16996208, 16997217, 16996767, 16996441, 16996029, 16995810, 16998520, 17002528, 16995947, 16996610, 16996732, 17001565, 16999075, 16996826, 16996695, 16996569, 17001399, 16996630, 16996606, 16996319, 16997180, 17001270], "descendants": 197, "text": "This has been done two other times before:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13139638 (2016),\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9799007 (2015)<p>Both threads generated a lot of really interesting discussion, and I was curious what the discussion would sound like if this were asked again in 2018.", "title": "Ask HN: What problem in your industry is a potential startup?", "by": "choogi", "score": 190, "time": 1525447451, "top_comment": {"kids": [16996303, 17000698, 16999207, 17000084, 16998145, 17000019, 16996369, 16997448, 16996336, 16999410, 16996063, 16996467, 16996004, 17001289, 16996570, 16996050, 16996133], "parent": 16995260, "text": "I&#x27;ll take a startup in a box.

To simplify the problem, I first split it into separate areas which I would tackle independently:", " Inspired by the triumphs of the \u201cAlphaGo\u201d project by DeepMind, I focused my research into the extensions and optimisation techniques that are so common in neural network design. There are many useful packages in machine learning, such as tensor flow, which can generate complex neural networks which work well, very quickly, but for this project I really wanted to develop an understanding of the inner workings of modern neural networks. So I went through the arduous calculus myself giving a much less efficient but more rewarding program.", "The goal with this project was to utilise, as far as possible, the enthusiasm\nand research into neural networks and machine learning within academia,\nwhile allowing me to further explore the intriguing world of prime numbers.", " Researching into the myriad of prime number checking algorithms was more difficult; information about them online was confusing and contradictory. This is one area where repl.it was very helpful, being able to quickly make precise time and accuracy measurements for each of the common primality verification algorithms and then producing graphics and visuals to help wade through the dense data was both faultless and invaluable to this project. Beyond this, the ability to use the data manipulation capabilities of \u201cnumpy\u201d coupled with the complete customisability of \u201cmatplotlib\u201d in graphic generation, means that I've been able to expand my knowledge base in a remarkably practical direction, gaining the skills required to create much more interesting and fruitful plots than the visuals produced by Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.", " The next task was to attempt to reproduce and develop the findings of my research and actually create the neural network. I began with the forward propagation process, effectively, the executing of the network to produce a result. Underpinning the whole concept of neural networks and a large field of machine learning is the seemingly forced idea of passing data through neurons, which are linear single-output functions acting on the input data. In forward propagation, the input data is fed through a larger network of neurons each altering the data slightly to produce a new result. The reason this is so powerful, is that it allows for optimisation; each of the neurons can simply be repeatedly tweaked to produce better and better outputs. This is the process of back propagation, using multivariable calculus and matrices to accurately and remarkably efficiently arrive at the optimal set of neurons to produce the most useful output for a given task.

He recorded the dreams on waking, using the set-up he employed for writing his books, in his neat pencil handwriting, on lined A6 index cards.", "The usual reason people take an interest in their own dreams is to divine their meaning. That wasn\u2019t Nabokov\u2019s motive. The inspiration for his project came from An Experiment with Time, a book by J.W. Dunne, published in 1927 and renowned in its day. Dunne\u2019s theory was that time doesn\u2019t only run forwards in a linear direction, and that, as a result, dreams can contain glimpses of the future. Not that dreams, in Dunne\u2019s view, are only predictive: they mix past events, future events, and random mental fluff. The experiment of recording dreams at the moment of waking was to get evidence for precognition, through a contemporaneous record of dream-predictions which subsequently turn out to be accurate. An Experiment seems kooky now, but H.G. Wells took an interest, and so did the Tolkien/Lewis Inklings, and J.B. Priestley, among others. Dunne was an aeronautical engineer and former soldier, and part of the appeal of his book was probably that he dressed his speculations with the correct amount of scientific apparatus. It is also evident from reading him that he believed his own theory \u2013 so he might be a visionary and a fool and a crank, but he wasn\u2019t a liar or a con man.", "On that basis, Nabokov gave it a go. He already had a long-standing interest in dreams, which often crop up in his fiction. Gennady Barabtarlo, the Nabokov specialist who compiled, edited and wrote the commentary for Insomniac Dreams, puts together a chapter of dream-extracts from the fiction, divided into categories \u2013 filial, precognitive, erotic, \u2018oneiric realism\u2019 and so on. The varieties of dreams in the fiction are unsurprisingly similar to those in the dream-diary. Barabtarlo puts the dreams, and the project of recording them, in the context of Nabokov\u2019s troubles with insomnia, which were spectacular. Nabokovians have long known that their hero had problems with sleep \u2013 only a lifelong insomniac could have made the beautiful, terrible observation of Transparent Things, \u2018night is always a giant\u2019 \u2013 but the specifics are grim even so. \u2018My usual extent of sleep (apart from periodical insomnias), even if induced by more or less potent pills (at least thrice daily) is a 3+2+1 or at best 4+2+2 or at frequent worst 2+1+1+2+1-hour affair with intervals (+) of hopelessness and nervous urination.\u2019 This doesn\u2019t sound like much fun at all.

But Kondo didn\u2019t write her books for us; they were the product of a training seminar, a sort of literary incubator, for the Japanese marketplace. And she is only the most internationally successful of many writing on the topic in Japan.

Hiroshi Aoi, the president of the Marui Group, which operates Japan\u2019s largest retail chain, was uniquely positioned to see how drastically consumers cut back. In an interview in 2016, he told me that the Lost Decades represented a \u201cturning away from outward expressions of fashion.\u2026 The idea of personal fulfillment became the product, with things like foods, dining out, and leisure experiences rising to the forefront.\u201d If this sounds familiar, it is because the same pattern is now repeating among America\u2019s millennials.
